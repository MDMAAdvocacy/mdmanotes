Fatalities have occurred apparently as a result of combining MAOI medications with MDMA [147, 148]. For this reason, MAOI medications are tapered for at least five half-lives of the medication and active metabolites, plus 1 week for symptom stabilization in sponsor-supported studies.",

      "excerpt": "MDMA is generally classified as an entactogen or empathogen because its socioemotional effects differ from those of prototypic stimulants (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014), and it produces fewer perceptual alterations than hallucinogens (Schmid et al., 2015a). Specifically, MDMA increases feelings of closeness to others, trust, and openness and enhances emotional empathy for positive situations (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014). Such effects are not observed with stimulants that predominantly act on the DA system (Schmid et al., 2014). MDMA (Baggott et al., 2016) but not D-amphetamine (Childs et al., 2016) decreased social anxiety. MDMA selectively impaired the recognition of negative emotions (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014; Bedi et al., 2010; Wardle et al., 2014), whereas such stimulants as amphetamine and methylphenidate nonselectively enhanced the recognition of emotions (Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2012). These findings indicate that MDMA produces unique effects on emotion processing in healthy subjects that are likely linked to its predominant effects on the 5-HT system (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2012d; Hysek et al., 2012b) and may be useful in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (Sessa, 2016).",

Training with 1.5 mg/kg but not 3.0 mg/kg MDMA resulted in considering higher doses of a 5HT2A agonist a similar [179]. The same research team determined that dopamine antagonists interfered with the stimulus properties of amphetamine, but not MDMA [180].",

First, MDMA administration was shown to elevate plasma oxytocin levels and increase social interactions in laboratory rats.49 The increases in both oxytocin and pro-social behavior were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635. Furthermore, the oxytocin receptor antagonist tocinoic acid administered directly into the cerebral ventricles attenuated the effect of MDMA on social behavior in the animals. A subsequent study of regular ecstasy users given 100 mg MDMA in a controlled laboratory setting likewise found increased plasma oxytocin concentrations that were correlated with increases in subjective amicability and gregariousness.50 One caveat regarding the interpretation of plasma oxytocin results is that central (ie, within the brain) and peripheral (ie, in the bloodstream) oxytocin are derived from different populations of neurons; circulating oxytocin is thought to have poor penetrance across the blood–brain barrier, and it is the central oxytocin that is considered to be most important for the peptide’s pro-social effects.51 Nevertheless, we must consider the possibility that the increased sociality observed following MDMA consumption is mediated, at least in part, by a serotonergic enhancement of central and/or peripheral oxytocin release.",

      "excerpt": "Noradrenergic mechanisms appear particularly likely to be involved in the effects of MDMA (Hysek et al., 2012b). Duloxetine, which inhibits release of both serotonin and norepinephrine, reduced global effects of MDMA and euphoria as well as the visual analog items Closeness, Openness, and Talkativeness. Duloxetine also showed a nonsignificant trend effect on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, suggesting a possible attenuation of MDMA effects on empathy. Further, reboxetine, which inhibits MDMA-induced norepinephrine but not serotonin release, reduced “closeness,” but not the other social visual analog items (Hysek et al., 2011). Overall, this suggests both norepinephrine and serotonin release contribute to the social effects of MDMA in humans, although it is not clear how these mechanisms and effects relate to those of classic stimulant drugs.

Especially the inhibition of the D2 with haloperidol showed a significant reduction in MDMA positive effects (10). MDMA-unrelated pharmacogenetic studies showed a positive association of the minor allele of the DRD2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1079597 and rs1800497 with heroin dependence (41), rs6277 and rs1800497 with nicotine dependence (42), and rs6277 with alcohol dependence in males (43). The VNTR polymorphism within the gene coding for the subtype 4 of the DA receptors (DRD4) is also frequently studied in relation to psychiatric disorders and personality traits (44–47). DRD4 VNTR variations range from 2 repeats to 10 repeats, with 4 and 7 repeats as the most frequent forms (48). The presence of a 7-repeat allele has been linked with personal traits like high novelty seeking, risky decision making, and broad sexual interest (44, 47). Moreover, children and adolescents suffering from ADHD and carrying the 7-repeat allele had to take higher doses of methylphenidate to reach sufficient efficacy (49). This finding is in line with earlier results from an in vitro study showing a reduced sensitivity of the 7-repeat allele toward DA compared with the 2- and 4-repeat allele (50).",

Another recent study showed that genetic differences in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) may affect feelings of sociability in response to MDMA (Bershad et al., 2016); that is, individuals homozygous for the A allele at rs53576 did not report enhanced sociability on 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA, unlike G allele carriers. Importantly, methamphetamine does not appear to induce the release of oxytocin (Bershad et al., 2015), lending weight to the possibility that differing oxytocinergic effects may contribute to differential social effects of MDMA and prototypic stimulants.",

Numerous animal studies have shown that, following the acute 5-HT release produced by MDMA, there is a temporary period of 5-HT depletion.33 This effect is due to a combination of factors, including MDMA-induced inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis, and an inability of the serotonergic neurons to take up and recycle the released 5-HT because of the blockade of SERT activity. Some investigators have hypothesized that the aftereffects of recreational ecstasy use (eg, midweek blues) are due to a temporary 5-HT depletion,29 after which the symptoms wane as brain 5-HT levels are restored. However, because of the limitations associated with performing neurochemical measurements in living human subjects, this hypothesis remains unproven at the present time.",

Exogenous administration of both oxytocin and vasopressin can produce prosocial behavior, an effect that is blocked by a V1A vasopressin receptor antagonist but not an oxytocin antagonist (Ramos et al., 2013). This suggests oxytocin in high concentrations may significantly stimulate vasopressin receptors (Li et al., 2008), and raises the possibility that MDMA-induced vasopressin release may contribute to prosocial effects of the drug. MDMA and its metabolites induce vasopressin release from isolated rat hypothalamus (Fallon et al., 2002) and may elevate serum vasopressin (or the co-released copeptin) in humans (e.g. Henry et al., 1998; Simmler et al., 2011). However, V1A vasopressin receptor antagonism with SR49059 only partially blocked the prosocial effects of MDMA in rodents (Ramos et al., 2013), supporting a limited role for this pathway.",

In a recent review, Liechti (2015) hypothesized that this high ratio of serotonergic to dopaminergic effects is key for producing MDMA-like effects, and that similar drugs with a lower ratio produce more familiar, prototypic stimulant effects. One study showed that specifically blocking 5HT2A signaling reduced the positive mood-inducing effects of MDMA without affecting negative mood, which is particularly interesting in light of some of the drug’s similar effects to serotonergic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybin (Van Wel et al., 2012). While less studied, MDMA also induces acetylcholine release (Fischer et al., 2000; Nair and Gudelsky, 2006) and has low micromolar affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors (Battaglia et al., 1988).",

In a recent review, Liechti (2015) hypothesized that this high ratio of serotonergic to dopaminergic effects is key for producing MDMA-like effects, and that similar drugs with a lower ratio produce more familiar, prototypic stimulant effects. One study showed that specifically blocking 5HT2A signaling reduced the positive mood-inducing effects of MDMA without affecting negative mood, which is particularly interesting in light of some of the drug’s similar effects to serotonergic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybin (Van Wel et al., 2012). While less studied, MDMA also induces acetylcholine release (Fischer et al., 2000; Nair and Gudelsky, 2006) and has low micromolar affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors (Battaglia et al., 1988).",

      "excerpt": "“In contrast to the lack of research on DA involvement in the acute effects of MDMA, a number of pharmacological studies using various transporter inhibitors and receptor antagonists have provided information regarding the role of the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA in humans. Thus, pre- treatment with either SERT inhibitors (ie, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) or NET inhibitors have demonstrated significant, though incomplete, attenuation of many of the subjective, mood, and, in some cases, physiological effects of MDMA.38–41 Moreover, a recent study with the dual SERT/NET inhibitor duloxetine found an even greater diminution of MDMA’s subjective and physiological effects than seen following blockade of either SERT or NET alone.42 Importantly, administration of clonidine, a drug that inhibits noradrenergic neuronal firing by activating α2-adrenergic autoreceptors on the cells, failed to alter either the psycho- active or physiological effects of MDMA.43 Animal studies have additionally demonstrated that MDMA actually suppresses the firing of both serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons in the brainstem.44 Thus, it appears that many of MDMA’s acute effects result from a combined release of both 5-HT and NE, apparently by transporter reversal rather than a stimulation of neuronal firing. ...Serotonin acts on more than a dozen different receptor subtypes, which complicates the task of elucidating which of these subtypes might underlie the various effects of MDMA. The general approach to this problem has been to coadminister either a 5-HT receptor antagonist or placebo along with MDMA to determine whether any subjective or physiological responses are blunted or blocked by the antagonist. Studies with the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin (which is partially selec-tive for the 5-HT subtype), but not pinadol, a combined 5-HT1A and β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, demonstrated a blunting of both the positive mood and perceptual effects of MDMA.38,45,46 Interestingly, 5-HT receptors have been implicated in the perceptual distortions and hallucinations produced by LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and other classic hallucinogens.47 On this basis, it seems reasonable to conclude that this same serotonergic receptor subtype contributes to the perceptual changes experienced by ecstasy users. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which subtypes, if any, might play a role in the other subjective and physiological effects of MDMA. With respect to NE, α1-, α2A-, and β3-adrenergic receptors are involved in various ways in MDMA-induced hyperthermia,48 but there is currently no information on which adrenergic receptor subtypes might contribute to MDMA-related mood changes.”",

However, many of these reports used 10 to 20 mg/kg MDMA, a dose range that is 5 to 10.7 times greater than the 1.5 to 2 mg/kg doses employed in human trials, making it less likely that these changes can be generalized to humans given lower doses. However, even at these doses toxicity was not observed, and a self-administration study at clinically relevant doses reproduced findings of elevation of genes such as serum/glucocorticoid kinase 1 and 3 (Sgk1, Sgk3), which regulate glutamatergic signaling and are associated with neuroplasticity and learning, as well as processes involved in memory consolidation in serotonergic neurons [190]. These studies also report an increase in expression of genes that regulate the GABA transporter [184], which is expressed in GABAergic neurons indirectly regulated by glutamatergic afferent neurons.",

These subjective effects are predominately mediated by direct or indirect action on 5HT2A receptors [100, 265, 634], with at least one study concluding that the effects of MDMA upon positive mood are at least due in part to 5HT2A receptor activation [100]. In contrast, the 5HT1A receptor appears to be partially involved in producing the subjective effects of MDMA [100, 263-265]. Co- administration of the beta-blocker and 5HT1A antagonist, pindolol, along with 1.5 mg/kg MDMA to 15 men attenuated self-reported “dreaminess” and pleasantly experienced derealization after MDMA without attenuating MDMA-related reduction in performance on a task requiring visual attention, and co-administration of pindolol failed to alter the acute effects of 75 mg MDMA on self-reported mood [100, 263].",

An in vitro binding study comparing MDMA with several drugs that include cathinone derivatives suggests that contrary to an earlier report of low affinity for 5HT2A serotonin receptors, MDMA may have significant effects at the receptor [25]. MDMA likely modulates 5HT1A serotonin receptors indirectly through serotonin release, though it is possible that MDMA may also act as a partial 5HT1A agonist in some brain areas [163]. Findings from other studies suggest that MDMA shares qualities with 5HT1A agonists.",

Controlled trials detected self-reported empathy or closeness to others in healthy volunteers [7, 10, 99], and starting in the late 2000s to 2010s, controlled studies measured effects of MDMA on social cognition or emotion [29, 30, 37]. Although researchers have offered several models and explanations for the effects of Entactogens, it appears that serotonin and norepinephrine release play a significant role in producing at least some of these effects. Indirect action on 5HT1A or 5HT2A receptors and neuroendocrine responses such as increases in the hormones oxytocin, AVP, prolactin, and cortisol may also play a role in producing the unique effects of MDMA.",

      "excerpt": "Most of the psychostimulant-like and psychological effects of MDMA are blocked after administration of the dual selective serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine [232, 636]. There is evidence that norepinephrine and serotonin may play a role in the elevation in the neuroendocrine hormone copeptin, the C-terminal precursor of pre-pro-AVP, detected in women acutely after MDMA administration [636]. Some in vitro findings with human monoamine transporters expressed in cells indicate that MDMA displays a higher affinity for the NET than the serotonin or dopamine transporter, while still producing greater detectable release of serotonin versus norepinephrine, suggesting a role for both transmitter systems [141]. As the NET unexpectedly has a greater affinity than the DAT for dopamine, it preferentially clears dopamine in brain areas where there is a greater concentration of NET, such as the frontal cortex [637]. The relative affinities of MDMA for various monoamine reuptake transporters, and the affinity of the respective transporters for each neurotransmitter, can thus influence the selectivity of signaling pathways MDMA activates in a region-specific manner depending on transporter density and availability.",

People with a variant of the SERT gene reported greater “fear” and ‘depression” after MDMA. These associations support the role of serotonin as a major contributor to producing the subjective effects of MDMA, but they were also no longer significant after correcting for number of tests. The study was likely underpowered for genetic analyses of four genes in a sample not selected for this purpose.",

(1987) showed that when MDMA was given to rats in a high dosage, DA levels were decreased in some brain regions. However, other research showed that treatment with MDMA/ecstasy has limited effect on the dopamine nerve endings in rats (Battaglia et al. 1987; Stone et al. 1986). In mice, MDMA seems to be a selective DA neurotoxin, while in rats a selective 5-HT neurotoxin (Stone et al. 1986). Therefore, Easton and Marsden questioned the ability to translate findings of animal studies on DA neurotoxicity to humans (Easton and Marsden 2006).",

      "excerpt": "MDMA is metabolised via two hepatic [relating to the liver] pathways. In the major pathway in rats, MDMA is O- demethylated by cytochrome P450 CYP2D1 and 3A2 to form HHMA, which is O-methylated to generate HMMA by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In the minor pathway in rats, MDMA is N-demethylated by CYP1A2 and 2D1 to form MDA, which is an active metabolite. MDA is O-demethylated by the same enzymes as MDMA, with subsequent metabolism by COMT. Metabolites of MDMA are excreted in urine as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. MDMA and metabolites have shorter half-lives in rats than humans at comparable doses based on plasma Cmax values. Rats tend to form more MDA and glucuronide-conjugated metabolites than humans [126]. As MDMA dose increases above 2.5 mg/kg subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) in rats, a larger percentage of the administered dose is shunted to the N-demethylation pathway, resulting in greatly enhanced formation of MDA [127]. Comparison of metabolic pathways between rats and mice given 10 mg/kg i.p. MDMA indicate that 49.1% of MDMA is metabolized through the HMMA pathway in mice versus 72% in rats, and 18.3% of MDMA is metabolized through the MDA pathway in mice versus 28% in rats based on AUC ratios to MDMA. MDMA at 10 mg/kg was also found to be eliminated more rapidly in mice (0.4 hours, i.p.) than rats at (1.1 hours, s.c.) [86, 128].",

The dose of 5.6 mg/kg was approximately two times a human equivalent dose based on plasma values, but the findings are the first biological evidence of a lasting effect of MDMA on disruption of anxiety-related behavior in mice. MDMA, (1 mg/kg, 2,5 and 5 mg/kg, not 1 or 10 mg/kg) given alone or with nicotine, enhanced consolidation of recall for a passive-avoidance task, a different type of fear memory [254, 273]. A fear extinction study in rats failed to replicate an enhancement of fear extinction, finding instead that 3 and 5 mg/kg MDMA administered prior to training impaired fear extinction learning, while MDMA administered during reconsolidation produced persistent reduction in fear [274].",

      "excerpt": "Pre-treatment or co-administration studies of SSRIs with MDMA appear to attenuate or eliminate most subjective, physiological and immunological effects of MDMA due to competition for binding sites on the SERT which may prevent transporter- mediated serotonin release [99, 630-633]. Pre-treatment or co-administration with SSRIs attenuates serotonergic effects of MDMA on mood and perception, without influencing specific effects, such as nervousness or excitability [630]...Some researchers report that SSRIs attenuate MDMA-induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure [99, 631], while others report that SSRIs only attenuate elevated heart rate [633]. Additional effects of each SSRI beyond reuptake inhibition on production, release, and degradation of serotonin are likely responsible for variations between SSRI co-administration findings. All three studies of SSRI pre-treatment suggest that co-administration of SSRIs with MDMA is safe, but the combination prevents or significantly reduces the subjective effects of MDMA.",

Although it is well known from animal studies that MDMA administration induces a massive release of 5-HT and that frequent administrations of MDMA may induce neurotoxic effects on the 5-HT system (Commins et al. 1987; Lyles and Cadet 2003), administration of MDMA may also induce changes on other neurotransmitter systems. Indeed, Battaglia et al. (1988) showed that MDMA has non- negligible affinity for not only 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors, but also α1-adrenergic receptors, α2-adrenergic receptors, β- adrenergic receptors, muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors, DA D1 and D2 receptors, opioid receptors and benzodiazepine receptor sites.”",

MDMA appears to alter the conformation of the transporters, enabling monoamines to diffuse out of the neuron rather than being actively transported into the presynaptic neuron. MDMA was found to compete with monoamines for sites on the VMAT2, suggesting MDMA also promotes active release of monoamines from vesicular stores, in addition to inhibiting reuptake. MDMA extends the presence of monoamines in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting MAO-A, an enzyme that breaks down monoamines in the synapse. MDMA has self- limiting subjective and physiological effects.",

MDMA is metabolized in the liver by several enzymes. Active doses of MDMA may saturate CYP2D6 function for an extended period, with function normalizing up to 10 days post-MDMA. The enzymes CYP1A2, COMT, and MAO are also be involved in the metabolism of MDMA. MDMA is metabolized by N-demethylation to MDA. The parent compound and MDA are further O-demethylated to HHMA and HHA, respectively. Both HHMA and HHA are subsequently O- methylated mainly to HMMA and HMA. These four metabolites, particularly HMMA and HMA, are known to be excreted in the urine as conjugated glucuronide or sulfate metabolites.",

The chief mechanism behind its therapeutic effects is likely to be serotonergic, along with some norepinephrine and to a minor extent dopamine-mediated effect. Indirect, but potentially significant effects of MDMA include the release of the hormones cortisol, oxytocin, prolactin, and AVP. MDMA likely stimulates secretion of oxytocin into peripheral blood via indirect activation of 5HT1A, 5HT2C, and 5HT4 receptor subtypes, as well as AVP secretion via activation of 5HT2C, 5HT4, and 5HT7 receptor subtypes. Both oxytocin and AVP are implicated in the widespread regulation of behavioral aspects of mood and act on different target organs to modulate physiological functions in the body. Taken together, MDMA has a diverse array of pharmacodynamic effects in animals and humans.",

These transporters are responsible for reuptake of the respective transmitter following release from the nerve terminal, and members of the amphetamine family (including MDMA) can enter the terminal via the transporter and cause a reversal of its function (ie, transporter-mediated release of the transmitter). Consequently, MDMA acts on the serotonin transporter (SERT) to block 5-HT reuptake and stimulate 5-HT release, the DA transporter (DAT) to block DA reuptake and stimulate DA release, and the NE transporter (NET) to block NE reuptake and stimulate NE release.33,34 Although most of the research on MDMA interactions with monoamine transporters has involved rodent cells or tissues, this compound exerts qualitatively similar effects on human monoamine transporter proteins.35,36",

MDMA acts on the serotonin transporter and is transported into the nerve terminal. This promotes release of serotonin through the serotonin transporter by a process of transporter-mediated exchange. Whilst within the terminal, MDMA interferes with the storage of serotonin within the vesicles and thus increases the amount of serotonin available to be released (Rothman & Baumann, 2002). This process can lead to significant increases in serotonin available in the synapse.",
