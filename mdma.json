      "excerpt": "Noradrenergic mechanisms appear particularly likely to be involved in the effects of MDMA (Hysek et al., 2012b). Duloxetine, which inhibits release of both serotonin and norepinephrine, reduced global effects of MDMA and euphoria as well as the visual analog items Closeness, Openness, and Talkativeness. Duloxetine also showed a nonsignificant trend effect on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, suggesting a possible attenuation of MDMA effects on empathy. Further, reboxetine, which inhibits MDMA-induced norepinephrine but not serotonin release, reduced 'closeness', but not the other social visual analog items (Hysek et al., 2011). Overall, this suggests both norepinephrine and serotonin release contribute to the social effects of MDMA in humans, although it is not clear how these mechanisms and effects relate to those of classic stimulant drugs.",

      "excerpt": "In addition, empathy is also a multidimensional concept. For example, some early researchers tended to divide empathy into cognitive empathy and affective empathy and defined cognitive empathy as the process of accurately recognizing and understanding others’ feelings and emotions, whereas affective empathy is defined as emotional resonance or empathic accuracy, that is, the process of sharing other people’s feelings (Jones et al., 2010; Decety, 2011; Fan et al., 2011; Lang et al., 2011; Pasalich et al., 2014). Some later researchers further incorporated empathic concern—the specific emotional response to a person who is suffering, including sympathy, compassion, and being moved—into the components of empathy (Stocks et al., 2011; Stellar et al., 2015; Van der Graaff et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018) and thus formed the three-component view of empathy",

      "excerpt": "MDMA is generally classified as an ”entactogen” or ”empathogen” because its socio- emotional effects differ from those of prototypic stimulants (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014), and it produces fewer perceptual alterations than hallucinogens (Schmid et al., 2015a). Specifically, MDMA increases feelings of closeness to others, trust, and openness and enhances emotional empathy for positive situations (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014). Such effects are not observed with stimulants that predominantly act on the DA system (Schmid et al., 2014). MDMA (Baggott et al., 2016) but not D-amphetamine (Childs et al., 2016) decreased social anxiety. MDMA selectively impaired the recognition of negative emotions (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014; Bedi et al., 2010; Wardle et al., 2014), whereas such stimulants as amphetamine and methylphenidate nonselectively enhanced the recognition of emotions (Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2012). These findings indicate that MDMA produces unique effects on emotion processing in healthy subjects that are likely linked to its predominant effects on the 5-HT system (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2012d; Hysek et al., 2012b) and may be useful in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (Sessa, 2016).",

      "excerpt": "MDMA is generally classified as an ”entactogen” or ”empathogen” because its socio- emotional effects differ from those of prototypic stimulants (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014), and it produces fewer perceptual alterations than hallucinogens (Schmid et al., 2015a). Specifically, MDMA increases feelings of closeness to others, trust, and openness and enhances emotional empathy for positive situations (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014). Such effects are not observed with stimulants that predominantly act on the DA system (Schmid et al., 2014). MDMA (Baggott et al., 2016) but not D-amphetamine (Childs et al., 2016) decreased social anxiety. MDMA selectively impaired the recognition of negative emotions (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014; Bedi et al., 2010; Wardle et al., 2014), whereas such stimulants as amphetamine and methylphenidate nonselectively enhanced the recognition of emotions (Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2012). These findings indicate that MDMA produces unique effects on emotion processing in healthy subjects that are likely linked to its predominant effects on the 5-HT system (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2012d; Hysek et al., 2012b) and may be useful in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (Sessa, 2016).",

At 1- 2.1 mg MDMA, 80% of participants identified MDMA as an empathogen or hallucinogen and only 20% identified MDMA as a stimulant [673]. In contrast, results were mixed with 0.25-0.75 mg/kg mCPP, with results varying from hallucinogen to stimulant to sedative depending on the dose. On the “drug liking” VAS, 1.6 mg/kg (p<0.004) and 2.1 mg/kg MDMA (p<0.008) were significantly higher than placebo, whereas mCPP ratings were not significantly higher than placebo at any dose [673].",

The evidence reviewed here suggests that compared with typical stimulants, MDMA has both shared and distinctive effects on social processing and social behavior. Prototypic stimulants increases self-reported feelings of friendliness, increase some aspects of verbal behavior, increase positive responses to stimuli (regardless of social or emotional content), and increase sexual arousal. MDMA more specifically increases self-reported feelings of trust and generosity, increases responses to social and emotionally valenced stimuli, increases empathy, and increases the social and emotional themes in spontaneous speech.",

Cognitive empathy is characterised by the subscales ‘perspective taking’ and ‘fantasy’, which respectively refer to the ability to understand the point of view of others, and the ability to imagine the mental states of fictional characters (such as in books or movies).",

Typically in these studies, participants perform a brief speech task with a research assistant and subsequently rate their interaction with the research assistant. In one study (Wardle and De Wit, 2014), MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) modestly increased the degree to which participants felt the research assistant understood and was interested in them. Interestingly, this effect is distinguishable from reports that the drug increased empathy for others. Here, MDMA increased perceptions of empathy from others. This appears consistent with the report by Baggott et al. (2016) that MDMA increased the comfort participants felt when describing autobiographical memories to a researcher. Increased feelings of being understood and accepted by real others provides additional evidence for the drug’s benefits in strengthening therapist–patient alliances in psychotherapy settings (Bouso et al., 2008; Johansen and Krebs, 2009; Mithoefer et al., 2011).",

This is usually measured by asking participants to identify the emotion expressed in images of faces, such as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) or the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (Bedi et al., 2010). Facial expressions are potent social cues that signal how others are feeling, and thus may guide appropriate social responses.",

First, MDMA administration was shown to elevate plasma oxytocin levels and increase social interactions in laboratory rats. The increases in both oxytocin and pro-social behavior were blocked by pretreat- ment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635. Furthermore, the oxytocin receptor antagonist tocinoic acid administered directly into the cerebral ventricles attenuated the effect of MDMA on social behavior in the animals. A sub- sequent study of regular ecstasy users given 100 mg MDMA in a controlled laboratory setting likewise found increased plasma oxytocin concentrations that were correlated with increases in subjective amicability and gregariousness. One caveat regarding the interpretation of plasma oxytocin results is that central (ie, within the brain) and peripheral (ie, in the bloodstream) oxytocin are derived from different populations of neurons; circulating oxytocin is thought to have poor penetrance across the blood–brain barrier, and it is the central oxytocin that is considered to be most important for the peptide’s pro-social effects. Nevertheless, we must consider the possibility that the increased sociality observed following MDMA consumption is mediated, at least in part, by a serotonergic enhancement of central and/or peripheral oxytocin release.",

Typically in these studies, participants perform a brief speech task with a research assistant and subsequently rate their interaction with the research assistant. In one study (Wardle and De Wit, 2014), MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) modestly increased the degree to which participants felt the research assistant understood and was interested in them. Interestingly, this effect is distinguishable from reports that the drug increased empathy for others. Here, MDMA increased perceptions of empathy from others. This appears consistent with the report by Baggott et al. (2016) that MDMA increased the comfort participants felt when describing autobiographical memories to a researcher. Increased feelings of being understood and accepted by real others provides additional evidence for the drug’s benefits in strengthening therapist–patient alliances in psychotherapy settings (Bouso et al., 2008; Johansen and Krebs, 2009; Mithoefer et al., 2011).",

Through natural language processing (NLP), researchers found speech patterns after MDMA were distinct from those produced after methamphetamine and placebo [40]. Proximity of speech to the concepts of friend, support, intimacy, rapport, and empathy was increased in the MDMA drug condition, which may bear some significance for the use of MDMA in therapy. MDMA did not affect the overall structure of participants’ speech. These findings were confirmed in an additional sample through a standardized dictionary method and machine learning, indicating that MDMA increased the use of social words, as well as words connoting positive and negative emotions [280]. There is some evidence that the increases in affiliative and prosocial feelings are separable from romantic or sexual feelings.",

Of 65 tablets/capsules analyzed between December 2012 and April 2013, 32 contained 67%–100% MDMA as the active ingredient, whereas 33 contained ,67% (and in many cases 0%) MDMA.13 Of the 32 that were composed mainly of MDMA, the average amount per tablet/capsule was 205 mg (range 66–465 mg), although this value is likely an overestimate because most of the data entries do not account for the weight of inactive binder used in each tablet.13 Nevertheless, if we use the 205 mg value along with a user body weight of 60–70 kg, we can calculate a typical recreational MDMA dose as being approximately 3 mg/kg. Novice ecstasy users usually take one to two tablets per occasion; however, experienced users sometimes take four or more tablets per occasion.14 Consumption of multiple doses can reflect “stacking” (taking more than one tablet at a time) and/or “boosting” (taking additional tablets later in a session to maintain drug-induced effects).15 Evidence for increased MDMA consumption over time is thought to reflect drug-related tolerance, which has been confirmed in experimental animal studies (see Tolerance section below).",

          "excerpt": "MDMA is generally classified as an “entactogen” or “empathogen” because its socio- emotional effects differ from those of prototypic stimulants (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014), and it produces fewer perceptual alterations than hallucinogens (Schmid et al., 2015a). Specifically, MDMA increases feelings of closeness to others, trust, and openness and enhances emotional empathy for positive situations (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014). Such effects are not observed with stimulants that predominantly act on the DA system (Schmid et al., 2014). MDMA (Baggott et al., 2016) but not D-amphetamine (Childs et al., 2016) decreased social anxiety. MDMA selectively impaired the recognition of negative emotions (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014; Bedi et al., 2010; Wardle et al., 2014), whereas such stimulants as amphetamine and methylphenidate nonselectively enhanced the recognition of emotions (Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2012). These findings indicate that MDMA produces unique effects on emotion processing in healthy subjects that are likely linked to its predominant effects on the 5-HT system (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2012d; Hysek et al., 2012b) and may be useful in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (Sessa, 2016).",

In a study comparing MDMA and methamphetamine, Bedi et al. (2014) reported that speech following 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA had greater semantic proximity to concepts of “friend, support, intimacy, and rapport,” and 0.75 mg/kg had greater proximity to empathy. By contrast, methamphetamine (20 mg) did not increase the social content of speech. Thus, while both MDMA and prototypic stimulant drugs affect speech, their effects appear to be different, perhaps reflecting the different character of their social effects.",

Interestingly, the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin (0.16 mg/kg) appears to have similar effects on amygdala reactivity as MDMA, dampening responses to negative emotional faces (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). Taken together, these findings indicate that MDMA has distinctive effects on emotional processing compared with amphetamine at the neural level. These findings help to explain why MDMA reduces social anxiety (i.e. by reducing responses to negative or threatening social stimuli and increasing responses to positive stimuli), and may also lend support for the idea that these effects are partly a result of the drug’s serotonergic activity.",

Through natural language processing (NLP), researchers found speech patterns after MDMA were distinct from those produced after methamphetamine and placebo [40]. Proximity of speech to the concepts of friend, support, intimacy, rapport, and empathy was increased in the MDMA drug condition, which may bear some significance for the use of MDMA in therapy. MDMA did not affect the overall structure of participants’ speech. These findings were confirmed in an additional sample through a standardized dictionary method and machine learning, indicating that MDMA increased the use of social words, as well as words connoting positive and negative emotions [280]. There is some evidence that the increases in affiliative and prosocial feelings are separable from romantic or sexual feelings.",

The present study clearly indicated that MDMA has a different effect profile than the stimulant methylphenidate at the doses used, supporting previous, albeit less rigorous, study findings (Bershad et al. 2016; Hysek et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2015b; Schmid et al. 2014). Specifically, MDMA increased well-being, good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, feelings of closeness to others, and wanting to be with others, and reduced state anxiety compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used. The distinct mood effects of MDMA were congruent with its effects on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT], including reductions of fear recognition and more misclassifications of emotions as happy. MDMA, but not methylphenidate, has previously been shown to reduce fear recognition on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT] (Bedi et al. 2010; Hysek et al. 2014b; Kirkpatrick et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2014). Additionally, MDMA, but not methylphenidate or modafinil, strongly increased endocrine markers of acutely increased serotonergic activity, including cortisol and prolactin (Seifritz et al. 1996; Sommers et al. 1994; Strajhar et al. 2016).

Additionally, MDMA releases serotonin (Hysek et al. 2012c; White et al. 1996) and oxytocin (Dumont et al. 2009; Hysek et al. 2012b; Hysek et al. 2014a; Kuypers et al. 2017; Schmid et al. 2014; Thompson et al. 2007), whereas methylphenidate and modafinil act as dopamine uptake inhibitors (Madras et al. 2006; Rothman et al. 2001). Consistent with the different pharmacological profiles of these substances, MDMA exerted distinct subjective effects across all of our rating scales (VASs, AMRS, ARCI, 5D-ASC, and SADI) compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used.

Prototypic stimulants increases self-reported feelings of friendliness, increase some aspects of verbal behavior, increase positive responses to stimuli (regardless of social or emotional content), and increase sexual arousal. MDMA more specifi- cally increases self-reported feelings of trust and generosity, increases responses to social and emotionally valenced stimuli, increases empa- thy, and increases the social and emotional themes in spontaneous speech.",

MDMA increased how positively participants rated positive social images (i.e. those depicting people), but decreased how positively they rated positive images without social content. The drug did not alter ratings of negative or neutral mages, whether social or non-social. In contrast, d-amphetamine (10 mg, 20 mg) enhanced positive emotional responses in general, but its effects were not specific to stimuli with social content (Wardle and De Wit, 2012).

A recent meta-analysis showed that a moderate reduction of serum sodium concentration is associated with an increased risk of death in different pathologic conditions [425]. Relationships have been found between reduced plasma sodium, a measure of hyponatremia, and variations in COMT and CYP2D6 genotypes, possibly related to increased AVP and oxytocin release associated with MDMA [292]. Active doses of MDMA likely inhibit CYP2D6 in most individuals, as described in Section 5.2.1 Pharmacokinetics. Behavioral factors, including vigorous exercise and excessive consumption of water without an attempt to replace electrolytes, and an increase in the anti-diuretic hormones AVP and oxytocin, likely all contribute to this very rare but serious condition in Ecstasy users [32]. Women are generally more likely to exhibit hyponatremia than men [426, 427], including Ecstasy or MDMA related hyponatremia [62]. Heart failure is commonly associated with hyponatremia, and is also characterized by increased concentrations of AVP [428-430]. Hyponatremia has not occurred during a controlled clinical trial with MDMA.",

Individuals experiencing these adverse effects have not been carefully screened based on eligibility criteria and are likely to have pre-existing medical conditions or underlying cardiac and/or pulmonary disease that influence metabolism and disposition of MDMA in the body. These events are relatively rare given the prevalence of Ecstasy use, estimated to be in the millions worldwide. The most common adverse effects include hyperthermia, psychiatric problems, hepatotoxicity secondary to hyperthermia, and hyponatremia (see Table 2). Overall, the risks of Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs) have been addressed and constrained by limited exposure and drug administration in controlled settings with adequate screening according to eligibility criteria defined in study protocols. To date, only one SAR of exacerbation of pre-existing ventricular extrasystoles has been reported within the context of MAPS-sponsored Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical studies. All SARs at least possibly related to MDMA and not included in Table 71 (below) should be considered unexpected and are subject to expedited reporting as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs). The table below was developed based on a survey of case reports that could be of concern in the published scientific literature on MDMA or Ecstasy.",

Reducing ambient temperature and administering the 5HT2A antagonist ketanserin reduced lethality, suggesting that amplified elevation in body temperature and activity at serotonin receptors may promote lethality in group-housed mice given MDMA [212]. Considerable variation across studies in environmental factors, that are often underspecified in published reports, contribute to challenges in extrapolating findings in animal studies that may be relevant in epidemiological settings.Numerous serious events, including fatalities, have been reported in humans after Ecstasy use in unsupervised and uncontrolled settings. These events are relatively rare given the prevalence of Ecstasy use [57, 58]. These include hyperthermia (potentially arising from “serotonin syndrome”), psychiatric problems, hepatotoxicity (secondary to hyperthermia), cardiac disorders and hyponatremia [57, 60-62, 478]. Set and setting likely play a role in the development of some Ecstasy-related AEs, such as vigorous exercise, lack of attention to somatic cues, and too little or too much hydration combined with pharmacological action on AVP resulting in hyperthermia or hyponatremia [59, 424]. Even if ambient temperature does less to moderate the effects of MDMA on body temperature than originally believed based on animal studies, other environmental and behavioral factors, as those related to vigorous exercise, may be involved. It is important to note that not all reports of AEs in Ecstasy users provide information on whether MDMA was detected in plasma or other fluids, with some relying on self-report or the reports of friends as to identity of substances consumed. Reports indicating detectable MDMA will thus be the best indicators of an actual association. Unexpected SARs have not occurred in any of the human MDMA research studies thus far.",

Further studies that control for confounding factors show no evidence of neurotoxicity with MDMA when used in isolation (21) and no lasting neurocognitive impairments (22). Given that Ecstasy has such widespread use—second only to cannabis in popularity as an illicit drug—these epidemiological and experimental data demonstrate its relative safety.",

At doses closer to those humans ingest [219], monkeys exhibit only slight to moderate elevation in body temperature [220, 221]. In contrast to findings in rodents, primates are not susceptible to changes in ambient temperature when given MDMA, exhibiting slight to moderate increases in body temperature regardless of the temperature of the environment [219-221], though at least one study found that the ambient temperature influenced the effects of 1.5 mg/kg i.v. MDMA on body temperature in monkeys, with lower body temperatures seen after MDMA administered in cool temperatures and higher body temperatures in another group given MDMA at warm temperatures [222]. Findings in rodents do not extrapolate well to primates in this area. Given that the thermoregulatory effects in rodents are highly dose-dependent, most physiological effects seen after low to moderate MDMA administration suggest that a controlled environment and moderate doses would be sufficient to mediate physiological complications associated with hyperthermia, including cardiovascular, osmoregulatory, neurological, and immunological effects.",

A recent meta-analysis showed that a moderate reduction of serum sodium concentration is associated with an increased risk of death in different pathologic conditions [425]. Relationships have been found between reduced plasma sodium, a measure of hyponatremia, and variations in COMT and CYP2D6 genotypes, possibly related to increased AVP and oxytocin release associated with MDMA [292]. Active doses of MDMA likely inhibit CYP2D6 in most individuals, as described in Section 5.2.1 Pharmacokinetics. Behavioral factors, including vigorous exercise and excessive consumption of water without an attempt to replace electrolytes, and an increase in the anti-diuretic hormones AVP and oxytocin, likely all contribute to this very rare but serious condition in Ecstasy users [32]. Women are generally more likely to exhibit hyponatremia than men [426, 427], including Ecstasy or MDMA related hyponatremia [62]. Heart failure is commonly associated with hyponatremia, and is also characterized by increased concentrations of AVP [428-430]. Hyponatremia has not occurred during a controlled clinical trial with MDMA.",

      "excerpt": "Intravenous MDMA doses that cause lethality in 50% of the cases, known as the LD50, are 97 mg/kg in mice, 49 mg/kg in rats, 14 to 18 mg/kg in dogs, and 22 mg/kg in monkeys [117]. LD50 may vary across strains, sexes, and housing conditions [474-476]. For example, LD50 in mice housed together is 20 mg/kg, which is considerably lower than in isolated animals [212, 477]. Reducing ambient temperature and administering the 5HT2A antagonist ketanserin reduced lethality, suggesting that amplified elevation in body temperature and activity at serotonin receptors may promote lethality in group-housed mice given MDMA [212]. Considerable variation across studies in environmental factors, that are often underspecified in published reports, contribute to challenges in extrapolating findings in animal studies that may be relevant in epidemiological settings.Numerous serious events, including fatalities, have been reported in humans after Ecstasy use in unsupervised and uncontrolled settings. These events are relatively rare given the prevalence of Ecstasy use [57, 58]. These include hyperthermia (potentially arising from “serotonin syndrome”), psychiatric problems, hepatotoxicity (secondary to hyperthermia), cardiac disorders and hyponatremia [57, 60-62, 478]. Set and setting likely play a role in the development of some Ecstasy-related AEs, such as vigorous exercise, lack of attention to somatic cues, and too little or too much hydration combined with pharmacological action on AVP resulting in hyperthermia or hyponatremia [59, 424]. Even if ambient temperature does less to moderate the effects of MDMA on body temperature than originally believed based on animal studies, other environmental and behavioral factors, as those related to vigorous exercise, may be involved. It is important to note that not all reports of AEs in Ecstasy users provide information on whether MDMA was detected in plasma or other fluids, with some relying on self-report or the reports of friends as to identity of substances consumed. Reports indicating detectable MDMA will thus be the best indicators of an actual association. Unexpected SARs have not occurred in any of the human MDMA research studies thus far.",

A recent meta-analysis showed that a moderate reduction of serum sodium concentration is associated with an increased risk of death in different pathologic conditions [425]. Relationships have been found between reduced plasma sodium, a measure of hyponatremia, and variations in COMT and CYP2D6 genotypes, possibly related to increased AVP and oxytocin release associated with MDMA [292]. Active doses of MDMA likely inhibit CYP2D6 in most individuals, as described in Section 5.2.1 Pharmacokinetics. Behavioral factors, including vigorous exercise and excessive consumption of water without an attempt to replace electrolytes, and an increase in the anti-diuretic hormones AVP and oxytocin, likely all contribute to this very rare but serious condition in Ecstasy users [32]. Women are generally more likely to exhibit hyponatremia than men [426, 427], including Ecstasy or MDMA related hyponatremia [62]. Heart failure is commonly associated with hyponatremia, and is also characterized by increased concentrations of AVP [428-430]. Hyponatremia has not occurred during a controlled clinical trial with MDMA.",

Hyperpyrexia (> 40C) is rare but represents the most important life-threatening complication of recreational MDMA use (Wood et al., 2016; Liechti et al., 2005; Liechti, 2014; Grunau et al., 2010; Halpern et al., 2011; Henry et al., 1992). No controlled clinical study of MDMA has reported MDMA-induced hyperpyrexia, possibly because the participants were treated with moderate single doses at rest, were well-hydrated, and were not in a hot or crowed environment, unlike in some recreational settings that are known to increase the risk of hyperpyrexia (Dafters, 1995).",

In contrast, MDMA preferentially increases serotonin and norepinephrine release (Rothman et al., 2001; Rudnick and Wall, 1992) and induces dopamine release indirectly as a consequence of serotonergic release (Gudelsky and Nash, 1996; Koch and Galloway, 1997). MDMA directly inhibits dopamine reuptake (Verrico et al., 2007). In a recent review, Liechti (2015) hypothesized that this high ratio of serotonergic to dopaminergic effects is key for producing MDMA-like effects, and that similar drugs with a lower ratio produce more familiar, prototypic stimulant effects.",

      "excerpt": "Thus, by these measures, there are clear differences between classic stimulants and MDMA. Interestingly, the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin (0.16 mg/kg) appears to have similar effects on amygdala reactivity as MDMA, dampening responses to negative emotional faces (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). Taken together, these findings indicate that MDMA has distinctive effects on emotional processing compared with amphetamine at the neural level. These findings help to explain why MDMA reduces social anxiety (i.e. by reducing responses to negative or threatening social stimuli and increasing responses to positive stimuli), and may also lend support for the idea that these effects are partly a result of the drug’s serotonergic activity.",

Animals trained to discriminate MDMA (right graph) showed a similar dose dependent function of drug appropriate responding for MDMA as the AMPH group did for their training drug (n=7), however, no dose of AMPH substituted for MDMA (n=2). The D1 antagonist (SCH23390) reduced the ability of AMPH trained rats to discriminate AMPH from saline at doses that had no impact on the ability of MDMA trained rats to discriminate the training dose of MDMA from saline (although at the highest dose MDMA discrimination was also impaired).",

In a study comparing MDMA and methamphetamine, Bedi et al. (2014) reported that speech following 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA had greater semantic proximity to concepts of “friend, support, intimacy, and rapport,” and 0.75 mg/kg had greater proximity to empathy. By contrast, methamphetamine (20 mg) did not increase the social content of speech. Thus, while both MDMA and prototypic stimulant drugs affect speech, their effects appear to be different, perhaps reflecting the different character of their social effects.",

      "excerpt": "Thus, by these measures, there are clear differences between classic stimulants and MDMA. Interestingly, the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin (0.16 mg/kg) appears to have similar effects on amygdala reactivity as MDMA, dampening responses to negative emotional faces (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). Taken together, these findings indicate that MDMA has distinctive effects on emotional processing compared with amphetamine at the neural level. These findings help to explain why MDMA reduces social anxiety (i.e. by reducing responses to negative or threatening social stimuli and increasing responses to positive stimuli), and may also lend support for the idea that these effects are partly a result of the drug’s serotonergic activity.",

(2010) reported MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated amygdala activity during presentation of angry faces, and enhanced ventral striatum activity during presentation of happy faces. The ventral striatum is activated during reward anticipation of both social and nonsocial reward (Haber and Knutson, 2010), and the amygdala is involved in the processing of threat-related information (Whalen et al., 1998; Zald, 2003). In contrast to the effect of MDMA, Wardle et al. (2012) found that amphetamine magnified EMG responses to negative emotional stimuli, and Hariri et al. (2002) showed that amphetamine potentiated amygdala responses to fearful and angry faces.",

      "excerpt": "MDMA not only exhibits some amphetamine-like properties but also shows hallucinogenic-like effects and can be considered an intermediate substance between a pure stimulant like D-amphetamine and a pure hallucinogenic drug like LSD. MDMA acutely induces feelings of well-being, love, empathy, and prosociality [14, 15], and produces mild perceptual alterations that are thought to be primarily mediated by the release of serotonin (5-HT) [16, 17] and norepinephrine [18], and the direct activation of 5-HT2A receptors [19]. Additionally, MDMA releases oxytocin [14, 20, 21], which may contribute to the mediation of its prosocial effects [22, 23]. The unique emotional effects of MDMA lead to its classification as an empathogen or entactogen [24], referring to assumingly distinct effects from psychostimulants [25,26,27,28]. Psychostimulants such as D-amphetamine and methamphetamine primarily activate dopamine and norepinephrine systems, with only minimal effects on 5-HT [29, 30], and promote stimulation, wakefulness, and concentration without the MDMA-typical emotional effects [25, 27, 28, 31,32,33,34,35]. Although MDMA produces less profound changes in perception compared with classic hallucinogens, it is often also classified as a psychedelic substance.",

Vollenweider et al found that orally administered MDMA at a dose of 1.5 to 1.7 mg/kg produced some of the same effects as the classic hallucinogen psilocybin (eg, depersonalization, perceptual disturbances, and thought disorder), but, in contrast to psilocybin, there was little in the way of overt hallucinations.24",

      "excerpt": "MDMA is generally classified as an “entactogen” or “empathogen” because its socio- emotional effects differ from those of prototypic stimulants (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014), and it produces fewer perceptual alterations than hallucinogens (Schmid et al., 2015a). Specifically, MDMA increases feelings of closeness to others, trust, and openness and enhances emotional empathy for positive situations (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014). Such effects are not observed with stimulants that predominantly act on the DA system (Schmid et al., 2014). MDMA (Baggott et al., 2016) but not D-amphetamine (Childs et al., 2016) decreased social anxiety. MDMA selectively impaired the recognition of negative emotions (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014; Bedi et al., 2010; Wardle et al., 2014), whereas such stimulants as amphetamine and methylphenidate nonselectively enhanced the recognition of emotions (Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2012). These findings indicate that MDMA produces unique effects on emotion processing in healthy subjects that are likely linked to its predominant effects on the 5-HT system (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2012d; Hysek et al., 2012b) and may be useful in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (Sessa, 2016).",

In a study comparing MDMA and methamphetamine, Bedi et al. (2014) reported that speech following 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA had greater semantic proximity to concepts of “friend, support, intimacy, and rapport,” and 0.75 mg/kg had greater proximity to empathy. By contrast, methamphetamine (20 mg) did not increase the social content of speech. Thus, while both MDMA and prototypic stimulant drugs affect speech, their effects appear to be different, perhaps reflecting the different character of their social effects.Taken together, the evidence reviewed here suggests that stim- ulant drugs alter speech in ways that are consistent with their effects on social behaviors. Methamphetamine and d-amphetamine increased talkativeness and speech fluency, whereas MDMA appears to increase the emotional and social content of speech.",

Through natural language processing (NLP), researchers found speech patterns after MDMA were distinct from those produced after methamphetamine and placebo [40]. Proximity of speech to the concepts of friend, support, intimacy, rapport, and empathy was increased in the MDMA drug condition, which may bear some significance for the use of MDMA in therapy. MDMA did not affect the overall structure of participants’ speech. These findings were confirmed in an additional sample through a standardized dictionary method and machine learning, indicating that MDMA increased the use of social words, as well as words connoting positive and negative emotions [280]. There is some evidence that the increases in affiliative and prosocial feelings are separable from romantic or sexual feelings.",

Additionally, MDMA releases serotonin (Hysek et al. 2012c; White et al. 1996) and oxytocin (Dumont et al. 2009; Hysek et al. 2012b; Hysek et al. 2014a; Kuypers et al. 2017; Schmid et al. 2014; Thompson et al. 2007), whereas methylphenidate and modafinil act as dopamine uptake inhibitors (Madras et al. 2006; Rothman et al. 2001). Consistent with the different pharmacological profiles of these substances, MDMA exerted distinct subjective effects across all of our rating scales (VASs, AMRS, ARCI, 5D-ASC, and SADI) compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used. Consistent with the present study, we previously reported greater well-being, happiness, extroversion, and feelings of closeness after 125 mg MDMA administration compared with 60 mg methylphenidate (Hysek et al. 2014b) and after 75 mg MDMA administration compared with 40 mg methylphenidate (Schmid et al. 2014).",

      "excerpt": "The present study clearly indicated that MDMA has a different effect profile than the stimulant methylphenidate at the doses used, supporting previous, albeit less rigorous, study findings (Bershad et al. 2016; Hysek et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2015b; Schmid et al. 2014). Specifically, MDMA increased well-being, good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, feelings of closeness to others, and wanting to be with others, and reduced state anxiety compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used. The distinct mood effects of MDMA were congruent with its effects on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT], including reductions of fear recognition and more misclassifications of emotions as happy. MDMA, but not methylphenidate, has previously been shown to reduce fear recognition on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT] (Bedi et al. 2010; Hysek et al. 2014b; Kirkpatrick et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2014). Additionally, MDMA, but not methylphenidate or modafinil, strongly increased endocrine markers of acutely increased serotonergic activity, including cortisol and prolactin (Seifritz et al. 1996; Sommers et al. 1994; Strajhar et al. 2016). MDMA, but not methylphenidate or modafinil, also markedly increased pupil size at rest and after light stimulation, which is consistent with a previous study (Hysek and Liechti 2012) and other serotonergic substances (Schmid et al. 2015a). On the [Addiction Research Center Inventory ARCI], methylphenidate and modafinil produced significantly fewer sedating effects than MDMA, which is consistent with their greater stimulant-type properties.",

      "excerpt": "The primary research question was whether MDMA is simply a stimulant or whether it has unique namely prosocial and empathogenic effects that are distinct from other stimulants (Bershad et al. 2016). The present study clearly indicated that MDMA has a different effect profile than the stimulant methylphenidate at the doses used, supporting previous, albeit less rigorous, study findings (Bershad et al. 2016; Hysek et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2015b; Schmid et al. 2014). Specifically, MDMA increased well-being, good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, feelings of closeness to others, and wanting to be with others, and reduced state anxiety compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used. The distinct mood effects of MDMA were congruent with its effects on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT], including reductions of fear recognition and more misclassifications of emotions as happy. MDMA, but not methylphenidate, has previously been shown to reduce fear recognition on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT] (Bedi et al. 2010; Hysek et al. 2014b; Kirkpatrick et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2014). Additionally, MDMA, but not methylphenidate or modafinil, strongly increased endocrine markers of acutely increased serotonergic activity, including cortisol and prolactin (Seifritz et al. 1996; Sommers et al. 1994; Strajhar et al. 2016).

Additionally, MDMA releases serotonin (Hysek et al. 2012c; White et al. 1996) and oxytocin (Dumont et al. 2009; Hysek et al. 2012b; Hysek et al. 2014a; Kuypers et al. 2017; Schmid et al. 2014; Thompson et al. 2007), whereas methylphenidate and modafinil act as dopamine uptake inhibitors (Madras et al. 2006; Rothman et al. 2001). Consistent with the different pharmacological profiles of these substances, MDMA exerted distinct subjective effects across all of our rating scales (VASs, AMRS, ARCI, 5D-ASC, and SADI) compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used.

Prototypic stimulants increases self-reported feelings of friendliness, increase some aspects of verbal behavior, increase positive responses to stimuli (regardless of social or emotional content), and increase sexual arousal. MDMA more specifi- cally increases self-reported feelings of trust and generosity, increases responses to social and emotionally valenced stimuli, increases empa- thy, and increases the social and emotional themes in spontaneous speech.",

MDMA increased how positively participants rated positive social images (i.e. those depicting people), but decreased how positively they rated positive images without social content. The drug did not alter ratings of negative or neutral mages, whether social or non-social. In contrast, d-amphetamine (10 mg, 20 mg) enhanced positive emotional responses in general, but its effects were not specific to stimuli with social content (Wardle and De Wit, 2012).

These events are relatively rare given the prevalence of Ecstasy use [57, 58]. These include hyperthermia (potentially arising from “serotonin syndrome”), psychiatric problems, hepatotoxicity (secondary to hyperthermia), cardiac disorders and hyponatremia [57, 60-62, 478]. Set and setting likely play a role in the development of some Ecstasy-related AEs, such as vigorous exercise, lack of attention to somatic cues, and too little or too much hydration combined with pharmacological action on AVP resulting in hyperthermia or hyponatremia [59, 424].",

      "excerpt": "This is relevant since it is still debated whether ecstasy use/administration is indeed neurotoxic. There are several techniques developed that claim to measure neurotoxicity, e.g. immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, reactive gliosis and silver staining. However, these techniques differ in sensitivity and specificity and it can be questioned whether they all can demonstrate 5-HT neurotoxicity. Immunocytochemistry can be used to look at the structural and functional integrity of the assessed neurotransmitter system. Immunohistochemistry can be used to assess 5-HT axon degeneration; with this technique concentrations of 5- hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 5-HT and the SERT can be measured (Battaglia et al. 1987; Commins et al. 1987). Glial activation (reactive gliosis) is a response to all nervous system injury, and silver staining is a direct way to stain degenerating neurons (O’Callaghan and Sriram 2005). However, there are several limitations of these techniques. It is argued that immunohistochemistry should be validated by other means, because the neurotransmitter levels could be un- measurable due to pharmacological depletions, while the neuron itself can be intact (Baumann et al. 2007; Chang and Slikker Jr 1995). Silver staining is not selective for damage to serotonergic axons but also measures loss of other types of neurons. However, this technique is very useful for measuring neuronal loss (Jensen et al. 1993; O’Callaghan and Miller 1993). In fact, no SPECT or PET tracer is available that can directly assess serotonergic/dopaminergic toxicity or degener- ation per se. So, until yet, whether or not a lowered receptor/ transporter binding as assessed by PET/SPECT studies in humans represents neurotoxicity is still a matter of interpretation . Importantly, MDMA is not only used recreationally. Some researchers proposed to treat patients with MDMA, e.g. as a catalyst in psychotherapy for PTSD patients (Amoroso 2015; Doblin et al. 2014; White 2014), which further highlights the need to be able to assess whether or not the use of ecstasy is neurotoxic to humans.",

Some experi- mental studies in rodents and primates indicate that adminis- tration of MDMA damages the structural and functional in- tegrity of the 5-HT system.

      "excerpt": "Most studies suggested that heavy but not moderate Ecstasy users had impaired verbal memory and lower numbers of estimated SERT sites, assessed via imaging with radioactively labeled ligands in positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission tomography (SPECT), with heavy use often defined as 50 or more times or tablets. Taken together, findings from these studies suggest there is some risk of long-term effects in heavy Ecstasy users with respect to number of estimated SERT sites in specific brain areas and performance on measures of memory. However, interpreting findings of changes in serotonin receptors or cognitive function after repeated Ecstasy use are complicated by the possible impact of polydrug use and other potential pre-existing factors in retrospective reports, and the findings are not readily transferrable to use of MDMA in a therapeutic or research context.",

      "excerpt": "Spurred on by animal studies that found repeated or high doses of MDMA damaged the axons of serotonin neurons, researchers began studying the effects of repeated non-medical or recreational use of Ecstasy in humans [91-93, 294]. Early investigations had several methodological flaws, including retrospective design and poor matching of Ecstasy users with appropriate controls [97, 295]. Later studies sought to remedy some of these problems by using carefully matched polydrug user or cannabis user controls, or by relying on a sample with relatively low exposure to psychoactive substances, including alcohol [296-299].\n\n Researchers comparing the average reported Ecstasy/MDMA use of samples in imaging studies with average use in a large, global internet survey found participants in imaging studies were in the top 5 to 10% in terms of size of usual dose and amount taken per occurrence [300]. Imaging studies may not represent effects in people reporting average use, or in people enrolled in clinical trials. Some of these investigators also conducted longitudinal studies, comparing Ecstasy users, sometimes alongside controls, at two separate time points [301-303].\n\nResearchers using slightly different methods have reported differing results. These include finding no differences between Ecstasy user and polydrug user controls in SERT binding sites [304], modest reductions in estimated SERT sites in Ecstasy users versus non-drug using or cannabis-using controls [305], and an association between decreased SERT sites and lifetime Ecstasy use [306]. This study also reported finding slightly fewer 5HT2A receptor binding sites in both “Ecstasy preferring” and “hallucinogen preferring” groups.\n\nStudies in low to moderate Ecstasy users did not report an increase in this marker [307], and only one of three studies in heavy users detected a change in 5HT2A receptor density. [308-310]. A systematic meta-analysis of imaging studies collected up through August 2018 detected reduced SERT binding in eight of 13 regions examined, including parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, anterior and posterior cingulate, thalamus, and hippocampus with reduced SERT sites associated with duration of abstinence [311]. The lack of association between reduced SERT binding and lifetime episodes of use might be related many imaging studies sampling from people already reporting high lifetime Ecstasy use, and removal of one study from the analysis eliminated the association with time since last use.",

      "excerpt": "Many investigations have examined cognitive function in Ecstasy users with the goal of demonstrating long-term effects of purported neurotoxicity of Ecstasy. Rogers and colleagues performed a meta-analysis on a large number of retrospective studies of Ecstasy users and various cognitive functions. Given methodological flaws in this type of analysis, the investigators cautiously concluded that there might be a significant effect of Ecstasy use on verbal memory, and a lesser effect on visual memory [61].\n\nRetrospective designs and inappropriately matched samples continue to appear in the literature [457-459], even when using multiple control groups. Two meta-analyses of memory in Ecstasy users arrived at somewhat contradictory conclusions [460, 461]. Both detected an association between Ecstasy use and impaired performance on at least some measures of memory. However, one reported that this association had a medium to large effect size with no effect of Ecstasy dose [460], while the other reported that the association had a small to medium effect size with an Ecstasy dose effect, and that polydrug use itself contributed to impaired cognitive function [461].\n\nA meta-analysis comparing current Ecstasy users and drug-using controls on visuospatial skills reported that current users performed less well on measures of visual recall, recognition and item production than controls [462], but found no significant relationship between lifetime Ecstasy use and visuospatial task performance. A longitudinal study comparing people who continued to use Ecstasy with those who did not do so detected lower performance on immediate and delayed visual memory [463]. In a second follow-up in the same sample reported lower scores in visual memory, at marginal significance and no further impairment [464]. An examination of the relationship between elements of Ecstasy use history and verbal memory reported that use in the past year, especially in men, was associated with impaired verbal memory [465]. The authors suggest that gender differences in polydrug use may be involved.\n\n A study comparing performance on a test of verbal memory in 65 Ecstasy users enrolled in clinical trials of MDMA and an equal number of age and gender matched non-drug using controls from other trials failed to detect significant differences between the two groups [466]. This study employed a pre-determined measure of clinical significance, 1.5 times the average standard deviation of the healthy controls and used a Bayesian statistical test suited for assessing a null hypothesis. It is notable that none of the participants were enrolled in studies designed to compare cognitive function in ecstasy users, which may have reduced anxiety and potential risk of “stereotype threat” that may be faced by substance users completing assessments of cognitive function, which was done to reduce expectancy in the study [467].",

      "excerpt": "A prospective study in moderate Ecstasy users also failed to find any chemical markers of neuronal injury, and only found decreased cerebral blood volume in the dorsolateral frontal cortex [307, 312]. The same meta-analysis, described above, also failed to find any association between Ecstasy use and chemical markers of neuronal injury or CBF changes in basal ganglia [311]. A re-examination of brain imaging using the less specific SERT marker Beta-CIT indicate an inverse relationship between age of first use of Ecstasy and mid-number of midbrain serotonin sites without detecting any relationship between age of first use and frontal SERT sites [313]. A retrospective imaging study using a radioligand that maps serotonin synthesis found lower ligand presence (“trapping”) in prefrontal, orbitofrontal and parietal areas and higher presence in brainstem, frontal and temporal areas in Ecstasy users versus polydrug user controls, with a greater difference seen in men [314]. The researchers reported relationships between differences in trapping and cumulative use, duration and temporal proximity of use. The samples were not well-matched for drug use.\n\nStudies comparing brain activity in Ecstasy users and non-Ecstasy using controls reported some but not many differences in brain activity. These included greater brain activation in the occipital cortex, with concomitant methamphetamine use contributing to increased activation to a visual stimulus [315]. The same group of researchers detected less within-region coherence in the thalamus in Ecstasy users who averaged 29 episodes of use when compared with non-Ecstasy- using controls [316]. In a retrospective study, Ecstasy users exhibited lower brain activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with controls reporting no illicit drug use, with neither group exhibiting impaired task performance [317]. Ecstasy users exhibited a single difference in brain activity compared to polydrug using controls. A prospective study comparing brain activity before and after use of Ecstasy failed to detect differences in working memory, attention or brain activity [318], suggesting a relationship between repeated, regular use of Ecstasy and other drugs and changes in brain activation. Investigations of the interaction between genotype and regular Ecstasy use have supported differential effects upon reward-based attention or visual or verbal memory [319-321], with some findings supporting differences due to genotype and some failing to do so. A systematic examination of imaging studies comparing ecstasy users reporting consumption of 100 or fewer tablets with controls reported finding no evidence for an association between moderate Ecstasy and signs of structural or functional changes in the brain [87]. Given the small samples and uneven numbers with different genotypes, any conclusions await further support.\n\nSleep disturbances are thought to be associated with deficiencies in serotonergic signaling [322]. Examining sleep architecture in Ecstasy users, investigators found less total sleep time and less stage 3 and 4 sleep on the adaptation night, but no overall differences in sleep architecture [323]. Another study comparing heavy Ecstasy users with non-drug using controls found no differences in baseline sleep using electroencephalography (EEG) [324]. Early studies in mostly heavy Ecstasy users reported significant decreases in total sleep as well as stage 2 sleep [325], while studies conducted in the 2000s found Ecstasy users were able to fall asleep more easily upon depletion of catecholamine neurotransmitters suggesting an underlying difference in serotonergic control of sleep architecture [326, 327]. Findings of sleep disruption in Ecstasy users are not likely to be applicable to the exposures seen in research or therapeutic settings. \n\nA study of breathing during sleep in 71 Ecstasy users and 62 polydrug users did not find overall differences in disrupted breathing, assessed via nasal cannula, but found that all moderate and severe breathing disruptions occurred in the Ecstasy using sample [328]. McCann and colleagues reported a relationship between cumulative (lifetime) Ecstasy exposures and instances of disrupted breathing during non-REM sleep and suggested Ecstasy users could be vulnerable to potentially fatal sleep apnea. In contrast, other researchers failed to find greater night-time awakenings indicative of sleep apnea in Ecstasy users [323, 324], and the high rate of disrupted breathing McCann and colleagues detected even in the controls suggest that this measure may not provide clinically significant assessments. Taken together, it appears that MDMA acutely produces lighter sleep with fewer REM periods.",

Human studies use nonrandom assignment and often test extremely heavy users; these deficits could have been present prior to MDMA use or may have been the result of very heavy atypical use. Since low doses (i.e., 1 to 2 mg/kg) of pure MDMA produce similar pharmacokinetic, pharmacological, and psychoactive effects in animals and humans (Baumann et al., 2007, 2009; Green et al., 2009, 2012a) and do not produce cognitive impairments in animals, we suspect that low doses of pure MDMA also do not impair cognition in humans.",

A recently published meta-analysis took careful steps to overcome methodological limitations in previous work, and found only modest indicators of long-term impairment in cognitive function in humans [61]. A systematic review of brain imaging studies in moderate ecstasy users found no convincing evidence for structural or functional changes [87]. Reports of AEs, such as hyperthermia, following Ecstasy use [88-90] and studies in Ecstasy users reporting changes in serotonin transporter (SERT) density, impaired memory and executive function raised concerns regarding the safety of MDMA administration [91-95]. However uncontrolled studies of Ecstasy use and nonclinical animal studies that use inappropriately high doses of MDMA produce findings that are open to several interpretations [86, 96]. The vast majority of publications of Ecstasy users are retrospective reports in polydrug- users [61, 97].",

The results thus far have failed to show any serotonergic deficits in these low-dose users; however, other abnormalities were found related to brain vasculature and white matter structure. 114,115 Thus, the jury is still out on whether damaging effects can be produced by consuming even a few ecstasy tablets.",

A recently published meta-analysis took careful steps to overcome methodological limitations in previous work, and found only modest indicators of long-term impairment in cognitive function in humans [61]. A systematic review of brain imaging studies in moderate ecstasy users found no convincing evidence for structural or functional changes [87]. Reports of AEs, such as hyperthermia, following Ecstasy use [88-90] and studies in Ecstasy users reporting changes in serotonin transporter (SERT) density, impaired memory and executive function raised concerns regarding the safety of MDMA administration [91-95]. However uncontrolled studies of Ecstasy use and nonclinical animal studies that use inappropriately high doses of MDMA produce findings that are open to several interpretations [86, 96]. The vast majority of publications of Ecstasy users are retrospective reports in polydrug- users [61, 97].",

The results can be explained in two ways. Either former MDMA users do not show any difference in SERT binding during MDMA use and this remains the case after abstinence, or a period of prolonged abstinence from MDMA use allows a recovery of SERT availability. \n\nThe second explanation would clearly seem more likely given the large body of preclinical and some clinical studies consistently showing neurotoxic effects of MDMA on brain serotonin transporters with current MDMA use. 8, 24.

      "excerpt": "As mentioned earlier, a number of studies have investigated the effect of the duration of ecstasy abstinence on the SERT binding by examining the reversibility of the SERT binding in relation to period of abstinence from MDMA use/administration.\n\nScheffel et al. (1998) already showed in a baboon study that SERT binding was increased from 40 days to 9 months after MDMA administration in the pons, midbrain and hypothalamus, whereas it remained decreased in cortical regions (pons: increase 35.7 %, mid- brain: increase 95 %, hypothalamus: increase 168.5 %).\n\nIn human studies, similar results were found. Reneman et al. (2001b) concluded that SERT [5-HT Transporter] binding of ex-MDMA users that stopped using MDMA for more than a year was similar to that binding of MDMA-naive controls.\n\nMoreover, Buchert et al. (2004) found a significant positive correlation between SERT binding and period of abstinence. Two years later, the same research group found a significant increase over the course of time of SERT binding of MDMA users and of SERT binding in the thalamus of ex-MDMA users, respectively (MDMA: P < 0.01; ex-MDMA: thalamus P = 0.006) (Buchert et al. 2006).\n\nSelvaraj et al. (2009) further supported the idea of SERT recovery; there was no difference in SERT binding between former ecstasy users and drug-naive controls after 1 year of abstinence.\n\nMoreover, Erritzoe et al. (2011) concluded that the duration of abstinence was positively related to SERT binding in pallidostriatum, amygdala and thalamus, but not in the neocortex. According to their data, recovery of the pallidostriatal SERT [5-HT Transporter] binding takes 200 days.\n\nIn conclusion, there seems to be some evidence that there is a recovery of SERT binding. If there is indeed recovery of SERT binding over time, the relevant question is then whether this recovery represents functionally intact 5-HT neurons.\n\nThe study of Reneman et al. (2001b) suggests that this may not be the case, because SERT binding in ex-MDMA users, who had stopped using MDMA for more than 1 year, was similar to control levels but demonstrated similar deficits on the RAVLT memory test as current MDMA users.\n\nIndeed, a couple of studies showed that even small doses of MDMA could lead to cognitive impairments, e.g. in verbal memory, and these impairments persist over time (Quednow et al. 2006; Schilt et al. 2007). \n\nA review of Parrott (2013) confirms that different cognitive functions can be affected by ecstasy use. There are deficits found not only in retrospective and prospective memory but also in higher cognition, complex visual processing, sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, pain, neurohormonal activity and psychiatric status. \n\nTherefore, recovery of SERT binding may reflect sprouting of 5-HT neurons or reduced endogenous neurotransmitter release after 5-HT toxicity has occurred, instead of recovery of the functional integrity of the 5-HT neurons. \nP3498 \nHowever, another study of Halpern et al. (2011) found little evidence in ecstasy users for cognitive impairments. This study was designed to minimize methodological limitations and concluded that studies on cognitive function should be interpreted with caution. If it is true that use of ecstasy does not lead to persistent cognitive impairments, the recovery of SERT binding may simply reflect normalization of the adaptation (e.g. down-regulation), which may occur initially after MDMA use.",

      "excerpt": "Moreover, this study showed a significant positive correlation between cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding and duration of abstinence from MDMA (P < 0.01). \n\nAlso, the same study showed, using an ex vivo technique in rats and using the same radiotracer, a decrease of binding followed by a time-dependent recovery of cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding, which was strongly and positively associated with the degree of 5-HT depletion (Reneman et al. 2002c). \n\nHowever, no positive correlation be-tween the 5-HT2A receptor binding and time of abstinence was found in the other studies (Di Iorio et al. 2012; Erritzoe et al. 2011; Urban et al. 2012). The time of abstinence in the study of Erritzoe et al. (2011) ranged between 1.6 and 36.9 weeks and in the study of Di Iorio et al. (2012) between 34 and 169.8 weeks, so these ranges should be large enough to evaluate a possible correlation between 5-HT2A receptor binding and time of abstinence. Moreover, the study of Urban et al. (2012) did not show a decrease in receptor binding, although the subjects were also relatively recent MDMA users (mean time of abstinence 5.7 weeks, ranging from 2 to 8 weeks), comparable to the study of Reneman et al. (2002c). So, all in all, findings on 5-HT2A receptor binding in MDMA users are inconsistent and it is uncertain if there is a relationship between time of abstinence and 5-HT2A receptor binding.”",

This greater effect of 3.2 mg/kg MDMA on NAc DA levels in females may have contributed to the more sustained ICSS facilitation by 3.2 mg/kg MDMA in females, and this conclusion is consistent with other evidence to suggest that facilitation of ICSS by monoamine releasers correlates with increases in NAc DA release (Suyama et al., 2016). This sex difference in MDMA effects on NAc DA levels is also consistent with previous reports that both amphetamine (Virdee et al., 2014) and cocaine (Holly et al., 2012) also produce greater increases in NAc DA levels in female compared to male rats. However, amphetamine-induced DA release does not differ significantly between females and males in dorsal striatum (Becker, 1999, Becker and Cha, 1989, Castner et al., 1993).",

One study showed that specifically blocking 5HT2A signaling reduced the positive mood-inducing effects of MDMA without affecting negative mood, which is particularly interesting in light of some of the drug’s similar effects to serotonergic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybin (Van Wel et al., 2012). While less studied, MDMA also induces acetyl- choline release (Fischer et al., 2000; Nair and Gudelsky, 2006) and has low micromolar affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors (Battaglia et al., 1988).",

Specifically, MDMA increases feelings of closeness to others, trust, and openness and enhances emotional empathy for positive situations (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014). Such effects are not observed with stimulants that predominantly act on the DA system (Schmid et al., 2014). MDMA (Baggott et al., 2016) but not D-amphetamine (Childs et al., 2016) decreased social anxiety. MDMA selectively impaired the recognition of negative emotions (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014; Bedi et al., 2010; Wardle et al., 2014), whereas such stimulants as amphetamine and methylphenidate nonselectively enhanced the recognition of emotions (Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2012). These findings indicate that MDMA produces unique effects on emotion processing in healthy subjects that are likely linked to its predominant effects on the 5-HT system (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2012d; Hysek et al., 2012b) and may be useful in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (Sessa, 2016).",

Of 65 tablets/capsules analyzed between Decem- ber 2012 and April 2013, 32 contained 67%–100% MDMA as the active ingredient, whereas 33 contained ,67% (and in many cases 0%) MDMA.13 Of the 32 that were composed mainly of MDMA, the average amount per tablet/capsule was 205 mg (range 66–465 mg), although this value is likely an overestimate because most of the data entries do not account for the weight of inactive binder used in each tablet.13 Nevertheless, if we use the 205 mg value along with a user body weight of 60–70 kg, we can calculate a typical recreational MDMA dose as being approximately 3 mg/kg. Novice ecstasy users usually take one to two tablets per occasion; however, experienced users sometimes take four or more tablets per occasion.14 Consumption of multiple doses can reflect “stacking” (taking more than one tablet at a time) and/or “boosting” (taking additional tablets later in a session to maintain drug-induced effects).15 Evidence for increased MDMA consumption over time is thought to reflect drug- related tolerance, which has been confirmed in experimental animal studies (see Tolerance section below).",

Of 65 tablets/capsules analyzed between Decem- ber 2012 and April 2013, 32 contained 67%–100% MDMA as the active ingredient, whereas 33 contained ,67% (and in many cases 0%) MDMA.13 Of the 32 that were composed mainly of MDMA, the average amount per tablet/capsule was 205 mg (range 66–465 mg), although this value is likely an overestimate because most of the data entries do not account for the weight of inactive binder used in each tablet.13 Nevertheless, if we use the 205 mg value along with a user body weight of 60–70 kg, we can calculate a typical recreational MDMA dose as being approximately 3 mg/kg. Novice ecstasy users usually take one to two tablets per occasion; however, experienced users sometimes take four or more tablets per occasion.14 Consumption of multiple doses can reflect “stacking” (taking more than one tablet at a time) and/or “boosting” (taking additional tablets later in a session to maintain drug-induced effects).15 Evidence for increased MDMA consumption over time is thought to reflect drug- related tolerance, which has been confirmed in experimental animal studies (see Tolerance section below).",

Several kinds of tolerance can occur, most notably pharmacokinetic or drug disposition tolerance due to an increased rate of drug inactivation, and pharmacodynamic tolerance due to reduced cellular sensitivity to the drug. Animal studies involving repeated MDMA administration have provided some evidence for tolerance development, although the opposite effect, which is called sensitization or reverse tolerance, occurred in some cases.15 Differences in dosing regimen and/or specific out- come measures likely account for these discrepant findings...Regular ecstasy users often report diminished responsiveness to the drug and a consequent need for dose escalation, both of which imply the development of tolerance. In a different approach, Farré et al52 and Peiró et al 53 studied the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of administering two doses of MDMA to human subjects at an interval of either 2 or 24 hours. Both studies found a higher than expected plasma concentration of MDMA after the second dose, which is a consequence of the drug inhibiting its own metabolism. In contrast, the subjective and physiological effects produced by the second dose were lower than expected based on the plasma concentration. These results suggest that tolerance to MDMA can develop quite rapidly, even potentially within a single session of drug use.",

In this study, subjects viewed and rated explicit erotic images, and pressed a button to increase image presentation time. Interestingly, methylphenidate increased arousal ratings and increased the average time participants chose to spend viewing implicit erotic images, whereas MDMA did not affect either of these measures. These findings suggest that classic stimulants, but not MDMA, increase desire for sexual contact. This is consistent with a rodent study showing that MDMA produced a transient disruption in male copulatory behavior (Dornan et al., 1991), and with user reports emphasizing increased emotional closeness and openness to sexual activity rather than sexual desire per se (Buffum and Moser, 1986; McElrath, 2005; Zemishlany et al., 2001).",

Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin. In contrast to MDMA, methylphenidate in- creased subjective anxiety, and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT.

      "excerpt": "Several population-based surveys document the prevalence of ecstasy use among adolescents and young adults. According to 2002 data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study,5 a nationally representative survey of US high school and college students, 12.7% of college students in the United States used ecstasy at least once in their lifetime6 (see Figure 1). According to the 2002 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, formerly the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse),7 15% of the population aged 18 to 25 years had tried ecstasy at least once in their lifetime, and almost 6% had used it in the past year. From 1996 to 2002, the use of ecstasy by 18- to 25-year-olds increased more than 200%.7,8...However, the rate of increase in ecstasy use among youths and young adults during the past 2 years appears to be slowing, as evidenced by both the NSDUH and the MTF Study, which estimate that 7.5% of high school seniors in 2004 had tried ecstasy at least once in their lifetime.6,7–9 The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), which documents drug-related emergency department mentions in major metropolitan areas of the United States, noted a sharp increase in ecstasy-related drug mentions between 1994 and 2001 and a decrease in the past 2 years.10 Anecdotal evidence from the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG), which has a diverse set of members that includes ethnographers and researchers that track recent drug trends in major metropolitan areas, highlights the widespread diffusion of ecstasy from the rave scene into more mainstream settings, including college campuses.11 The DEA similarly reports that, in addition to underground raves, nightclubs, and private residences, college campuses are popular settings in which ecstasy is used and sold. ...Although there have been few studies of college students in the United States that confirm the findings of these population-based trends, existing research suggests that ecstasy use among college students rose until about 2001 and has been decreasing every year since. A study of undergraduate students at Tulane University revealed an increase in lifetime ecstasy use from 16% in 1986 to 24% in 1990.12 A more recent study of a nationally representative sample of college students documented a 69% increase in ecstasy use from 1997 to 1999.13",

      "excerpt": "Trends in MDMA use have been well documented throughout the years with user age ranging from the 8th grade all the way to the college level and adulthood.  Review of epidemiological data revealed a significant increase in usage between the 1990s to early 2000s.  For example, lifetime ecstasy use on one college campus was found to increase from 16% to 24% between the years 1986 to 1990 while a national sample of college students saw a 69% increase between the years 1997 to 1999.[10]  From 1999 to 2000, lifetime use among 8th graders increased from 2.7% to 4.3% while this increase was significantly more in 12th graders (8% to 11%).  Also, emergency room visits in the United States were also found to increase from 253 to 4511 between 1994 and 2000.[11]  A 2002 “Monitoring the Future” study, found 12.7% of United States college students having used ecstasy once in their lifetime.  The 2002 National Survey of Drug Use and Health found a greater than 200% increase in ecstasy use by 18 to 25-year-olds from 1996 to 2002.[10] ...While the number of users increased significantly from the early 1990s and 2000s, the number of new users was variable from the period of 2002 to 2007.  Surveys found a decrease in users from 1.2 million in 2002 down to 642000 in 2003 then up to 860000 from 2006 to 2007.[12]  2011 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated about 14.5 million users aged 12 or older had used ecstasy at least once in their lifetime with approximately 900000 using it for the first time in 2011.  This number increased to 17 million in 2013 with the highest use among individuals aged 18 to 25 years. Though MDMA still falls behind cannabis, opioids, and other amphetamine use in the United States and worldwide, it remains a significant public health concern due to its adverse effect profile.[8]",

      "excerpt": "Several population-based surveys document the prevalence of ecstasy use among adolescents and young adults. According to 2002 data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study,5 a nationally representative survey of US high school and college students, 12.7% of college students in the United States used ecstasy at least once in their lifetime6 (see Figure 1). According to the 2002 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, formerly the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse),7 15% of the population aged 18 to 25 years had tried ecstasy at least once in their lifetime, and almost 6% had used it in the past year. From 1996 to 2002, the use of ecstasy by 18- to 25-year-olds increased more than 200%.7,8...However, the rate of increase in ecstasy use among youths and young adults during the past 2 years appears to be slowing, as evidenced by both the NSDUH and the MTF Study, which estimate that 7.5% of high school seniors in 2004 had tried ecstasy at least once in their lifetime.6,7–9 The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), which documents drug-related emergency department mentions in major metropolitan areas of the United States, noted a sharp increase in ecstasy-related drug mentions between 1994 and 2001 and a decrease in the past 2 years.10 Anecdotal evidence from the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG), which has a diverse set of members that includes ethnographers and researchers that track recent drug trends in major metropolitan areas, highlights the widespread diffusion of ecstasy from the rave scene into more mainstream settings, including college campuses.11 The DEA similarly reports that, in addition to underground raves, nightclubs, and private residences, college campuses are popular settings in which ecstasy is used and sold. ...Although there have been few studies of college students in the United States that confirm the findings of these population-based trends, existing research suggests that ecstasy use among college students rose until about 2001 and has been decreasing every year since. A study of undergraduate students at Tulane University revealed an increase in lifetime ecstasy use from 16% in 1986 to 24% in 1990.12 A more recent study of a nationally representative sample of college students documented a 69% increase in ecstasy use from 1997 to 1999.13",

      "excerpt": "Several population-based surveys document the prevalence of ecstasy use among adolescents and young adults. According to 2002 data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study,5 a nationally representative survey of US high school and college students, 12.7% of college students in the United States used ecstasy at least once in their lifetime6 (see Figure 1). According to the 2002 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, formerly the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse),7 15% of the population aged 18 to 25 years had tried ecstasy at least once in their lifetime, and almost 6% had used it in the past year. From 1996 to 2002, the use of ecstasy by 18- to 25-year-olds increased more than 200%.7,8...However, the rate of increase in ecstasy use among youths and young adults during the past 2 years appears to be slowing, as evidenced by both the NSDUH and the MTF Study, which estimate that 7.5% of high school seniors in 2004 had tried ecstasy at least once in their lifetime.6,7–9 The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), which documents drug-related emergency department mentions in major metropolitan areas of the United States, noted a sharp increase in ecstasy-related drug mentions between 1994 and 2001 and a decrease in the past 2 years.10 Anecdotal evidence from the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG), which has a diverse set of members that includes ethnographers and researchers that track recent drug trends in major metropolitan areas, highlights the widespread diffusion of ecstasy from the rave scene into more mainstream settings, including college campuses.11 The DEA similarly reports that, in addition to underground raves, nightclubs, and private residences, college campuses are popular settings in which ecstasy is used and sold. ...Although there have been few studies of college students in the United States that confirm the findings of these population-based trends, existing research suggests that ecstasy use among college students rose until about 2001 and has been decreasing every year since. A study of undergraduate students at Tulane University revealed an increase in lifetime ecstasy use from 16% in 1986 to 24% in 1990.12 A more recent study of a nationally representative sample of college students documented a 69% increase in ecstasy use from 1997 to 1999.13",

Most MDMA users consume the drug relatively infrequently and only for a few years in their early twenties (Green et al., 2003; Kuypers et al., 2016). The 2016 U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that about one-third of lifetime MDMA users aged 18–25 years had used the drug in the past year, while less than 8% of lifetime MDMA users aged 26 years and older had used the drug within the past year (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2016). Despite the low exposure, the long-term effects of MDMA use in young adulthood are a significant concern and one that is especially relevant to the current young adult population.",

      "excerpt": "Trends in MDMA use have been well documented throughout the years with user age ranging from the 8th grade all the way to the college level and adulthood.  Review of epidemiological data revealed a significant increase in usage between the 1990s to early 2000s.  For example, lifetime ecstasy use on one college campus was found to increase from 16% to 24% between the years 1986 to 1990 while a national sample of college students saw a 69% increase between the years 1997 to 1999.[10]  From 1999 to 2000, lifetime use among 8th graders increased from 2.7% to 4.3% while this increase was significantly more in 12th graders (8% to 11%).  Also, emergency room visits in the United States were also found to increase from 253 to 4511 between 1994 and 2000.[11]  A 2002 “Monitoring the Future” study, found 12.7% of United States college students having used ecstasy once in their lifetime.  The 2002 National Survey of Drug Use and Health found a greater than 200% increase in ecstasy use by 18 to 25-year-olds from 1996 to 2002.[10] ...While the number of users increased significantly from the early 1990s and 2000s, the number of new users was variable from the period of 2002 to 2007.  Surveys found a decrease in users from 1.2 million in 2002 down to 642000 in 2003 then up to 860000 from 2006 to 2007.[12]  2011 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated about 14.5 million users aged 12 or older had used ecstasy at least once in their lifetime with approximately 900000 using it for the first time in 2011.  This number increased to 17 million in 2013 with the highest use among individuals aged 18 to 25 years. Though MDMA still falls behind cannabis, opioids, and other amphetamine use in the United States and worldwide, it remains a significant public health concern due to its adverse effect profile.[8]",

According to 2002 data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study,5 a nationally representative survey of US high school and college students, 12.7% of college students in the United States used ecstasy at least once in their lifetime6 (see Figure 1). According to the 2002 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, formerly the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse),7 15% of the population aged 18 to 25 years had tried ecstasy at least once in their lifetime, and almost 6% had used it in the past year. From 1996 to 2002, the use of ecstasy by 18- to 25-year-olds increased more than 200%.7,8...However, the rate of increase in ecstasy use among youths and young adults during the past 2 years appears to be slowing, as evidenced by both the NSDUH and the MTF Study, which estimate that 7.5% of high school seniors in 2004 had tried ecstasy at least once in their lifetime.6,7–9 The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), which documents drug-related emergency department mentions in major metropolitan areas of the United States, noted a sharp increase in ecstasy-related drug mentions between 1994 and 2001 and a decrease in the past 2 years.10 Anecdotal evidence from the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG), which has a diverse set of members that includes ethnographers and researchers that track recent drug trends in major metropolitan areas, highlights the widespread diffusion of ecstasy from the rave scene into more mainstream settings, including college campuses.11 The DEA similarly reports that, in addition to underground raves, nightclubs, and private residences, college campuses are popular settings in which ecstasy is used and sold. ...Although there have been few studies of college students in the United States that confirm the findings of these population-based trends, existing research suggests that ecstasy use among college students rose until about 2001 and has been decreasing every year since. A study of undergraduate students at Tulane University revealed an increase in lifetime ecstasy use from 16% in 1986 to 24% in 1990.12 A more recent study of a nationally representative sample of college students documented a 69% increase in ecstasy use from 1997 to 1999.13",

Most MDMA users consume the drug relatively infrequently and only for a few years in their early twenties (Green et al., 2003; Kuypers et al., 2016). The 2016 U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that about one-third of lifetime MDMA users aged 18–25 years had used the drug in the past year, while less than 8% of lifetime MDMA users aged 26 years and older had used the drug within the past year (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2016). Despite the low exposure, the long-term effects of MDMA use in young adulthood are a significant concern and one that is especially relevant to the current young adult population.",

Though MDMA still falls behind cannabis, opioids, and other amphetamine use in the United States and worldwide, it remains a significant public health concern due to its adverse effect profile.[8]",

Studies in Ecstasy users indicated that only people reporting average lifetime exposure of 900 tablets had cardiac abnormalities indicative of potential VHD [287], and a case of VHD has occurred in a man reporting approximately 16 years of heavy Ecstasy use, from age 17 to 33 years old. [421]. No abnormalities were found in people reporting lifetime exposure of approximately 200 tablets in the same study. Echocardiographic readings in eight Ecstasy users also failed to find any cardiac abnormalities [52].",

A recent meta-analysis showed that a moderate reduction of serum sodium concentration is associated with an increased risk of death in different pathologic conditions [425]. Relationships have been found between reduced plasma sodium, a measure of hyponatremia, and variations in COMT and CYP2D6 genotypes, possibly related to increased AVP and oxytocin release associated with MDMA [292]. Active doses of MDMA likely inhibit CYP2D6 in most individuals, as described in Section 5.2.1 Pharmacokinetics. Behavioral factors, including vigorous exercise and excessive consumption of water without an attempt to replace electrolytes, and an increase in the anti-diuretic hormones AVP and oxytocin, likely all contribute to this very rare but serious condition in Ecstasy users [32].",

Rodent studies found that training attempts at self-administration required an increased training dose of 1.75 mg/kg for acquisition over a five- week period [583, 585-587]. Research that used rate of self-administered intracranial self- administration (ICSS) as a measure of abuse liability, and comparing response to 0.32, 1, or 3.2 and 3 mg/kg MDMA in male and female rats reported that MDMA increased responding for ICSS when the rate of responding for ICSS was low, and reduced seeking ICSS when rate of responding was very high in both sexes [157].",

The lack of group differences in mood 4 days after use, and even the day after use − when hours of sleep deprivation were controlled for − suggests that subsequent ecstasy use, which in regular Q4 ecstasy users would typically occur 7 days after baseline assessment, is not related to relief of withdrawal symptoms as suggested by previous investigators (e.g. Topp, et al., 1999; Cottler, et al., 2001).",

First, many ecstasy tablets contain psychoactive substances other than MDMA. Second, as discussed in the next section, most ecstasy users are polydrug users and, therefore, it is often unclear to what extent the psychological problems reported by these individuals are specifically attributable to their MDMA consumption.",

This has also been found in a laboratory study of MDMA 24 hours after drug administration (Liechti et al., 2001), though this was not replicated in a pooled analysis of nine other studies (Vizeli and Liechti, 2017). Low mood in the 7 days after administration has also been noted in some clinical trials of MDMA (Ot’alora G et al., 2018). Given some inconsistencies, it remains important to further characterise the subacute effects of MDMA on mood. This is particularly relevant given interest in MDMA as an adjunct to psychotherapy.",

MDA was also used in studies of drug-assisted psychotherapy (Turek et al., 1974; Yensen et al., 1976). ...Nevertheless, in the mid-1970s, Zeff stumbled upon MDA’s toxicity, which has produced some medical complications and even deaths (cf.

Among the 35 participants were veterans of psychedelic research (Grof, Naranjo, Yensen, Lynch, DiLeo) and psychotherapists using MDMA in their practices (Greer, Downing, Wolfson, Ingrasci). Greer (1985a: 58) noted in the conference report that MDMA . . .reduced defensiveness and fear of emotional injury, thereby facilitating more direct expression of feelings and opinions, and enabling people to receive both praise and criticism with more acceptance than usual. . . . Many subjects experienced the classic retrieval of lost traumatic memories, followed by the relief of emotional symptoms. ...The report included presentations by George Greer and Rick Ingrasci about MDMA therapy and by Richard Yensen outlining differences between MDMA and MDA. The evening was devoted to discussions about MDMA and procedures for facilitating MDMA experiences. On day 3, half of those interested in experiencing MDMA began their first MDMA session while the others assisted them. On day 5, discussions were held about scientifically valid research designs and the possible integration of MDMA into psychiatry (Greer, 1985a: 58).",

Psychologist Sallie Kueny (1980) administered MDMA to nine persons in a ‘‘nonclinical setting’’ (i.e., the subject’s living room) to evaluate its use in psychotherapy, especially in respect to the ‘‘therapeutic alliance’’ between patient and therapist. The report on the (unpublished) study includes a research protocol, a synopsis of the MDMA sessions and a follow-up after 9 months. Originally planned was the administration of MDMA at three occasions to each client, but the project was stopped for technical reasons after each client had received one MDMA session.No negative effects were registered during or after the sessions. All subjects reported positive experiences free of usual anxieties. Kueny concluded:this brief experiment yields enough provocative data to justify further research on that issue. . . . MDMA allows ordinary defenses against communication and closeness to relax, and permits those involved in its effects to deal with substantive issues. . . . The implications for using this agent in the therapeutic setting are enormous. (Kueny, 1980: 8, 16)",

      "excerpt": "In October 1984, a clinical study on the psychological and physiological effects of MDMA began in secrecy at a private house in Stinson Beach, California, initiated by EMDL and associated MDMA therapists. It was intended to gain objective data on the clinical effects of MDMA before it was scheduled. The study had neither Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (which was not necessary) nor the approval of an institutional review board, which some of the researchers involved thought would be appropriate but which was not sought so as to avert publicity....The study was conducted under the direction of Leo Zeff at the home of Jack Downing, who was also the study’s clinical coordinator (Doblin, 2001: 374)...Results of the study were used to support the therapeutic viewpoint during the hearings on the scheduling of MDMA and published in 1986 (Downing, 1986b).",

While the Expert Committee found the reports intriguing, it felt that the studies lacked the appropriate methodological design necessary to ascertain the reliability of the observations. There was, however, sufficient interest expressed to recommend that investigations be encouraged to follow up these preliminary findings. To that end, the Expert Committee urged countries to use the provisions of article 7 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances to facilitate research on this interesting substance. (World Health Organization, 1985: 25)...As reflected in the statement of the WHO’s expert committee, the question of methodologically sound research was critical. As Sidney Cohen, a former LSD researcher, suggested, ‘‘[i]f scientists want to study it, let them file an Investigational New Drug application with the Food and Drug Administration’’ (Cohen in Shafer, 1985: 69). This sounds easy, but the therapists feared that if MDMA was being scheduled, all therapeutic research would be stopped. In retrospect, this skepticism was realistic. However, there was no way to deny the necessity of appropriate scientific research.",

First, MDMA administration was shown to elevate plasma oxytocin levels and increase social interactions in laboratory rats.49 The increases in both oxytocin and pro-social behavior were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635. Furthermore, the oxytocin receptor antagonist tocinoic acid administered directly into the cerebral ventricles attenuated the effect of MDMA on social behavior in the animals. A subsequent study of regular ecstasy users given 100 mg MDMA in a controlled laboratory setting likewise found increased plasma oxytocin concentrations that were correlated with increases in subjective amicability and gregariousness.50 One caveat regarding the interpretation of plasma oxytocin results is that central (ie, within the brain) and peripheral (ie, in the bloodstream) oxytocin are derived from different populations of neurons; circulating oxytocin is thought to have poor penetrance across the blood–brain barrier, and it is the central oxytocin that is considered to be most important for the peptide’s pro-social effects.51 Nevertheless, we must consider the possibility that the increased sociality observed following MDMA consumption is mediated, at least in part, by a serotonergic enhancement of central and/or peripheral oxytocin release.",

      "excerpt": "Noradrenergic mechanisms appear particularly likely to be involved in the effects of MDMA (Hysek et al., 2012b). Duloxetine, which inhibits release of both serotonin and norepinephrine, reduced global effects of MDMA and euphoria as well as the visual analog items Closeness, Openness, and Talkativeness. Duloxetine also showed a nonsignificant trend effect on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, suggesting a possible attenuation of MDMA effects on empathy. Further, reboxetine, which inhibits MDMA-induced norepinephrine but not serotonin release, reduced “closeness,” but not the other social visual analog items (Hysek et al., 2011). Overall, this suggests both norepinephrine and serotonin release contribute to the social effects of MDMA in humans, although it is not clear how these mechanisms and effects relate to those of classic stimulant drugs.

      "excerpt": "“MDMA also directly and indirectly interacts with DA receptors (4). Especially the inhibition of the D2 with haloperidol showed a significant reduction in MDMA positive effects (10). MDMA-unrelated pharmacogenetic studies showed a positive association of the minor allele of the DRD2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1079597 and rs1800497 with heroin dependence (41), rs6277 and rs1800497 with nicotine dependence (42), and rs6277 with alcohol dependence in males (43). The VNTR polymorphism within the gene coding for the subtype 4 of the DA receptors (DRD4) is also frequently studied in relation to psychiatric disorders and personality traits (44–47). DRD4 VNTR variations range from 2 repeats to 10 repeats, with 4 and 7 repeats as the most frequent forms (48). The presence of a 7-repeat allele has been linked with personal traits like high novelty seeking, risky decision making, and broad sexual interest (44, 47). Moreover, children and adolescents suffering from ADHD and carrying the 7-repeat allele had to take higher doses of methylphenidate to reach sufficient efficacy (49). This finding is in line with earlier results from an in vitro study showing a reduced sensitivity of the 7-repeat allele toward DA compared with the 2- and 4-repeat allele (50).",

Another recent study showed that genetic differences in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) may affect feelings of sociability in response to MDMA (Bershad et al., 2016); that is, individuals homozygous for the A allele at rs53576 did not report enhanced sociability on 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA, unlike G allele carriers. Importantly, methamphetamine does not appear to induce the release of oxytocin (Bershad et al., 2015), lending weight to the possibility that differing oxytocinergic effects may contribute to differential social effects of MDMA and prototypic stimulants.",

Numerous animal studies have shown that, following the acute 5-HT release produced by MDMA, there is a temporary period of 5-HT depletion.33 This effect is due to a combination of factors, including MDMA-induced inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis, and an inability of the serotonergic neurons to take up and recycle the released 5-HT because of the blockade of SERT activity. Some investigators have hypothesized that the aftereffects of recreational ecstasy use (eg, midweek blues) are due to a temporary 5-HT depletion,29 after which the symptoms wane as brain 5-HT levels are restored. However, because of the limitations associated with performing neurochemical measurements in living human subjects, this hypothesis remains unproven at the present time.",

Exogenous administration of both oxytocin and vasopressin can produce prosocial behavior, an effect that is blocked by a V1A vasopressin receptor antagonist but not an oxytocin antagonist (Ramos et al., 2013). This suggests oxytocin in high concentrations may significantly stimulate vasopressin receptors (Li et al., 2008), and raises the possibility that MDMA-induced vasopressin release may contribute to prosocial effects of the drug. MDMA and its metabolites induce vasopressin release from isolated rat hypothalamus (Fallon et al., 2002) and may elevate serum vasopressin (or the co-released copeptin) in humans (e.g. Henry et al., 1998; Simmler et al., 2011). However, V1A vasopressin receptor antagonism with SR49059 only partially blocked the prosocial effects of MDMA in rodents (Ramos et al., 2013), supporting a limited role for this pathway.",

In a recent review, Liechti (2015) hypothesized that this high ratio of serotonergic to dopaminergic effects is key for producing MDMA-like effects, and that similar drugs with a lower ratio produce more familiar, prototypic stimulant effects. One study showed that specifically blocking 5HT2A signaling reduced the positive mood-inducing effects of MDMA without affecting negative mood, which is particularly interesting in light of some of the drug’s similar effects to serotonergic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybin (Van Wel et al., 2012). While less studied, MDMA also induces acetylcholine release (Fischer et al., 2000; Nair and Gudelsky, 2006) and has low micromolar affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors (Battaglia et al., 1988).",

In a recent review, Liechti (2015) hypothesized that this high ratio of serotonergic to dopaminergic effects is key for producing MDMA-like effects, and that similar drugs with a lower ratio produce more familiar, prototypic stimulant effects. One study showed that specifically blocking 5HT2A signaling reduced the positive mood-inducing effects of MDMA without affecting negative mood, which is particularly interesting in light of some of the drug’s similar effects to serotonergic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybin (Van Wel et al., 2012). While less studied, MDMA also induces acetylcholine release (Fischer et al., 2000; Nair and Gudelsky, 2006) and has low micromolar affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors (Battaglia et al., 1988).",

      "excerpt": "“In contrast to the lack of research on DA involvement in the acute effects of MDMA, a number of pharmacological studies using various transporter inhibitors and receptor antagonists have provided information regarding the role of the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA in humans. Thus, pre- treatment with either SERT inhibitors (ie, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) or NET inhibitors have demonstrated significant, though incomplete, attenuation of many of the subjective, mood, and, in some cases, physiological effects of MDMA.38–41 Moreover, a recent study with the dual SERT/NET inhibitor duloxetine found an even greater diminution of MDMA’s subjective and physiological effects than seen following blockade of either SERT or NET alone.42 Importantly, administration of clonidine, a drug that inhibits noradrenergic neuronal firing by activating α2-adrenergic autoreceptors on the cells, failed to alter either the psycho- active or physiological effects of MDMA.43 Animal studies have additionally demonstrated that MDMA actually suppresses the firing of both serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons in the brainstem.44 Thus, it appears that many of MDMA’s acute effects result from a combined release of both 5-HT and NE, apparently by transporter reversal rather than a stimulation of neuronal firing. ...Serotonin acts on more than a dozen different receptor subtypes, which complicates the task of elucidating which of these subtypes might underlie the various effects of MDMA. The general approach to this problem has been to coadminister either a 5-HT receptor antagonist or placebo along with MDMA to determine whether any subjective or physiological responses are blunted or blocked by the antagonist. Studies with the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin (which is partially selec-tive for the 5-HT subtype), but not pinadol, a combined 5-HT1A and β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, demonstrated a blunting of both the positive mood and perceptual effects of MDMA.38,45,46 Interestingly, 5-HT receptors have been implicated in the perceptual distortions and hallucinations produced by LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and other classic hallucinogens.47 On this basis, it seems reasonable to conclude that this same serotonergic receptor subtype contributes to the perceptual changes experienced by ecstasy users. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which subtypes, if any, might play a role in the other subjective and physiological effects of MDMA. With respect to NE, α1-, α2A-, and β3-adrenergic receptors are involved in various ways in MDMA-induced hyperthermia,48 but there is currently no information on which adrenergic receptor subtypes might contribute to MDMA-related mood changes.”",

However, many of these reports used 10 to 20 mg/kg MDMA, a dose range that is 5 to 10.7 times greater than the 1.5 to 2 mg/kg doses employed in human trials, making it less likely that these changes can be generalized to humans given lower doses. However, even at these doses toxicity was not observed, and a self-administration study at clinically relevant doses reproduced findings of elevation of genes such as serum/glucocorticoid kinase 1 and 3 (Sgk1, Sgk3), which regulate glutamatergic signaling and are associated with neuroplasticity and learning, as well as processes involved in memory consolidation in serotonergic neurons [190]. These studies also report an increase in expression of genes that regulate the GABA transporter [184], which is expressed in GABAergic neurons indirectly regulated by glutamatergic afferent neurons.",

These subjective effects are predominately mediated by direct or indirect action on 5HT2A receptors [100, 265, 634], with at least one study concluding that the effects of MDMA upon positive mood are at least due in part to 5HT2A receptor activation [100]. In contrast, the 5HT1A receptor appears to be partially involved in producing the subjective effects of MDMA [100, 263-265]. Co- administration of the beta-blocker and 5HT1A antagonist, pindolol, along with 1.5 mg/kg MDMA to 15 men attenuated self-reported “dreaminess” and pleasantly experienced derealization after MDMA without attenuating MDMA-related reduction in performance on a task requiring visual attention, and co-administration of pindolol failed to alter the acute effects of 75 mg MDMA on self-reported mood [100, 263].",

An in vitro binding study comparing MDMA with several drugs that include cathinone derivatives suggests that contrary to an earlier report of low affinity for 5HT2A serotonin receptors, MDMA may have significant effects at the receptor [25]. MDMA likely modulates 5HT1A serotonin receptors indirectly through serotonin release, though it is possible that MDMA may also act as a partial 5HT1A agonist in some brain areas [163]. Findings from other studies suggest that MDMA shares qualities with 5HT1A agonists.",

Although researchers have offered several models and explanations for the effects of Entactogens, it appears that serotonin and norepinephrine release play a significant role in producing at least some of these effects. Indirect action on 5HT1A or 5HT2A receptors and neuroendocrine responses such as increases in the hormones oxytocin, AVP, prolactin, and cortisol may also play a role in producing the unique effects of MDMA.",

      "excerpt": "Most of the psychostimulant-like and psychological effects of MDMA are blocked after administration of the dual selective serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine [232, 636]. There is evidence that norepinephrine and serotonin may play a role in the elevation in the neuroendocrine hormone copeptin, the C-terminal precursor of pre-pro-AVP, detected in women acutely after MDMA administration [636]. Some in vitro findings with human monoamine transporters expressed in cells indicate that MDMA displays a higher affinity for the NET than the serotonin or dopamine transporter, while still producing greater detectable release of serotonin versus norepinephrine, suggesting a role for both transmitter systems [141]. As the NET unexpectedly has a greater affinity than the DAT for dopamine, it preferentially clears dopamine in brain areas where there is a greater concentration of NET, such as the frontal cortex [637]. The relative affinities of MDMA for various monoamine reuptake transporters, and the affinity of the respective transporters for each neurotransmitter, can thus influence the selectivity of signaling pathways MDMA activates in a region-specific manner depending on transporter density and availability.",

People with a variant of the SERT gene reported greater “fear” and ‘depression” after MDMA. These associations support the role of serotonin as a major contributor to producing the subjective effects of MDMA, but they were also no longer significant after correcting for number of tests. The study was likely underpowered for genetic analyses of four genes in a sample not selected for this purpose.",

However, other research showed that treatment with MDMA/ecstasy has limited effect on the dopamine nerve endings in rats (Battaglia et al. 1987; Stone et al. 1986). In mice, MDMA seems to be a selective DA neurotoxin, while in rats a selective 5-HT neurotoxin (Stone et al. 1986). Therefore, Easton and Marsden questioned the ability to translate findings of animal studies on DA neurotoxicity to humans (Easton and Marsden 2006).",

      "excerpt": "MDMA is metabolised via two hepatic [relating to the liver] pathways. In the major pathway in rats, MDMA is O- demethylated by cytochrome P450 CYP2D1 and 3A2 to form HHMA, which is O-methylated to generate HMMA by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In the minor pathway in rats, MDMA is N-demethylated by CYP1A2 and 2D1 to form MDA, which is an active metabolite. MDA is O-demethylated by the same enzymes as MDMA, with subsequent metabolism by COMT. Metabolites of MDMA are excreted in urine as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. MDMA and metabolites have shorter half-lives in rats than humans at comparable doses based on plasma Cmax values. Rats tend to form more MDA and glucuronide-conjugated metabolites than humans [126]. As MDMA dose increases above 2.5 mg/kg subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) in rats, a larger percentage of the administered dose is shunted to the N-demethylation pathway, resulting in greatly enhanced formation of MDA [127]. Comparison of metabolic pathways between rats and mice given 10 mg/kg i.p. MDMA indicate that 49.1% of MDMA is metabolized through the HMMA pathway in mice versus 72% in rats, and 18.3% of MDMA is metabolized through the MDA pathway in mice versus 28% in rats based on AUC ratios to MDMA. MDMA at 10 mg/kg was also found to be eliminated more rapidly in mice (0.4 hours, i.p.) than rats at (1.1 hours, s.c.) [86, 128].",

      "excerpt": "MDMA given before training persistently enhanced fear extinction learning in mice through a BDNF-dependent mechanism [199], which could be a possible mechanism of action for MDMA in combination with psychotherapy as a treatment for anxiety disorders. The dose of 5.6 mg/kg was approximately two times a human equivalent dose based on plasma values, but the findings are the first biological evidence of a lasting effect of MDMA on disruption of anxiety-related behavior in mice. MDMA, (1 mg/kg, 2,5 and 5 mg/kg, not 1 or 10 mg/kg) given alone or with nicotine, enhanced consolidation of recall for a passive-avoidance task, a different type of fear memory [254, 273]. A fear extinction study in rats failed to replicate an enhancement of fear extinction, finding instead that 3 and 5 mg/kg MDMA administered prior to training impaired fear extinction learning, while MDMA administered during reconsolidation produced persistent reduction in fear [274].",

Pre-treatment or co-administration with SSRIs attenuates serotonergic effects of MDMA on mood and perception, without influencing specific effects, such as nervousness or excitability [630]...Some researchers report that SSRIs attenuate MDMA-induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure [99, 631], while others report that SSRIs only attenuate elevated heart rate [633]. Additional effects of each SSRI beyond reuptake inhibition on production, release, and degradation of serotonin are likely responsible for variations between SSRI co-administration findings. All three studies of SSRI pre-treatment suggest that co-administration of SSRIs with MDMA is safe, but the combination prevents or significantly reduces the subjective effects of MDMA.",

      "excerpt": "These effects are caused by MDMA, the main content of ecstasy tablets, through a mechanism of enhanced release of the neuro- transmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) as well as a relatively small release of another monoaminergic neurotransmit- ter, namely dopamine (2-(3,4-dihydroxyfenyl)-ethaanamine (DA)) (Lyles and Cadet 2003). Although it is well known from animal studies that MDMA administration induces a massive release of 5-HT and that frequent administrations of MDMA may induce neurotoxic effects on the 5-HT system (Commins et al. 1987; Lyles and Cadet 2003), administration of MDMA may also induce changes on other neurotransmitter systems. Indeed, Battaglia et al. (1988) showed that MDMA has non- negligible affinity for not only 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors, but also α1-adrenergic receptors, α2-adrenergic receptors, β- adrenergic receptors, muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors, DA D1 and D2 receptors, opioid receptors and benzodiazepine receptor sites.”",

      "excerpt": "MDMA is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, which concomitantly promotes carrier- mediated release, inhibits reuptake, and extends duration of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the synaptic cleft to increase serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission. MDMA appears to alter the conformation of the transporters, enabling monoamines to diffuse out of the neuron rather than being actively transported into the presynaptic neuron. MDMA was found to compete with monoamines for sites on the VMAT2, suggesting MDMA also promotes active release of monoamines from vesicular stores, in addition to inhibiting reuptake. MDMA extends the presence of monoamines in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting MAO-A, an enzyme that breaks down monoamines in the synapse. MDMA has self- limiting subjective and physiological effects.",

The enzymes CYP1A2, COMT, and MAO are also be involved in the metabolism of MDMA. MDMA is metabolized by N-demethylation to MDA. The parent compound and MDA are further O-demethylated to HHMA and HHA, respectively. Both HHMA and HHA are subsequently O- methylated mainly to HMMA and HMA.

The chief mechanism behind its therapeutic effects is likely to be serotonergic, along with some norepinephrine and to a minor extent dopamine-mediated effect. Indirect, but potentially significant effects of MDMA include the release of the hormones cortisol, oxytocin, prolactin, and AVP. MDMA likely stimulates secretion of oxytocin into peripheral blood via indirect activation of 5HT1A, 5HT2C, and 5HT4 receptor subtypes, as well as AVP secretion via activation of 5HT2C, 5HT4, and 5HT7 receptor subtypes. Both oxytocin and AVP are implicated in the widespread regulation of behavioral aspects of mood and act on different target organs to modulate physiological functions in the body. Taken together, MDMA has a diverse array of pharmacodynamic effects in animals and humans.",

These transporters are responsible for reuptake of the respective transmitter following release from the nerve terminal, and members of the amphetamine family (including MDMA) can enter the terminal via the transporter and cause a reversal of its function (ie, transporter-mediated release of the transmitter). Consequently, MDMA acts on the serotonin transporter (SERT) to block 5-HT reuptake and stimulate 5-HT release, the DA transporter (DAT) to block DA reuptake and stimulate DA release, and the NE transporter (NET) to block NE reuptake and stimulate NE release.33,34 Although most of the research on MDMA interactions with monoamine transporters has involved rodent cells or tissues, this compound exerts qualitatively similar effects on human monoamine transporter proteins.35,36",

MDMA acts on the serotonin transporter and is transported into the nerve terminal. This promotes release of serotonin through the serotonin transporter by a process of transporter-mediated exchange. Whilst within the terminal, MDMA interferes with the storage of serotonin within the vesicles and thus increases the amount of serotonin available to be released (Rothman & Baumann, 2002). This process can lead to significant increases in serotonin available in the synapse.",

Of note, however, was the apparent dissociation between self-report and VS recruitment in response to happy facial expressions. At the lower dose, MDMA enhanced neural response to happy faces without changing subjective sociability ratings. It is possible that brain responses to social stimuli are more sensitive indicators of prosocial effects, and that higher doses may be needed for individuals to report feeling more sociable. Moreover, it is not known whether the subjective experience of feeling social is essential for individuals to actually behave more sociably. Further research is required to clarify relationships between behavioral, subjective and neural dimensions of MDMA’s effects, and to better characterize active doses of MDMA in terms of sociability.”...“To our knowledge, no other drug has been found to increase subjective sociability while both attenuating [reducing the effect of] responses to social threat and increasing social reward responding. “",

In the future, research should test the effects of MDMA on more ecologically valid measures with more focus on the context, as both could be important for the effects of MDMA. This will allow delineation of which prosocial effects of MDMA are moderated by setting, and therefore could aid the development of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.",
