Taken together, the features of dependence in human ecstasy users fit well with the results from animal self-administration studies showing that, although rodents and nonhuman primates will self-administer MDMA intravenously, they do so much less avidly than in the case of cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, or opioids such as heroin or morphine.136,137”",
